An Introduction to AR App DevelopmentAugmented reality (AR) app development is the process of creating software applications that use AR technology to overlay virtual content on top of the physical world. AR technology uses a combination of sensors, cameras, and software algorithms to identify the position and orientation of real-world objects and then adds digital content to enhance the user’s perception of the world. AR app development has been around for a while, but it has gained more attention in recent years with the proliferation of smartphones and other mobile devices equipped with cameras, GPS, and other sensors. With the help of AR apps, users…!May 29, 2023#### Disruptive Immersive Technology for the EnterpriseCurrent XR Situation The XR market is expected to be valued over $460 billion in five years due to the exponential growth in demand for XR over the past two years.

This idea incorporates the three phenomena, and its emergence can be attributed to their growth and convergence. XR is also gathering momentum and having an impact on several processes and events at the same time. Let’s determine the meaning of this phenomenon, its primary capabilities, and its commercial value. The Origin of Extraordinary Reality Virtual, augmented, and mixed realities are all included under the general phrase “extended reality.” We must examine…!February 13, 2023#### What is XR and How Do I Get It?Everyone is talking about the new, intriguing technology known as XR. But what does XR actually entail, and when can this technology be used? We’ll examine how XR differs from AR and VR and how it will work with both new hardware and the gear you already have. Cross reality, often known as extended reality, is a general phrase for a number of distinct yet connected technologies. Similar abbreviations like VR (virtual reality), AR (augmented reality), and MR are combined (mixed reality). Knowing that information makes understanding XR much easier.

This includes:- Virtual Reality (VR), which usually involves the user wearing a headset that displays a simulation of the real world- Augmented Reality (AR), which enhances the real-world environment by overlaying digital elements- Mixed Reality (MR), which integrates elements of VR and AR, to create a blended experience where the virtual and physical interact seamlessly.Although XR technologies have existed for decades, there has been a surge in interest, investment and availability in recent years, especially in workplaces and consumer leisure sectors. The global market for XR is forecasted to surpass $1.1 trillion by 2030.Augmented reality content for mobile phones is already widely available for consumers to use in app stores like Google Play and the Apple App store, Bespoke platforms are also being developed in industrial and workplace settings. Virtual reality content is available in various forms including gaming and education platforms and often includes use of a headset.The emergence of Extended Reality (XR) technologies - YouTubeWeProtect Global Alliance210 subscribersWeProtect Global AllianceSearchWatch laterShareCopy linkInfoShoppingTap to unmuteIf playback doesn\\'t begin shortly, try restarting your device.Full screen is unavailable.

Unfortunately, as with any emerging technology there is a risk that offenders may use these new environments to exploit children.The Alliance’s  highlighted the risks posed to child safety, including opportunities for offenders to access victims, distribute child sexual abuse material, simulate abuse of virtual children, and use haptics to mimic real-world sensations like movement and force. Predators can also exploit ‘off-platforming’, where they move communication from XR environments to other platforms to groom children.In May 2024, we facilitated a roundtable discussion with leading experts to discuss key risks, challenges and opportunities to make the metaverse and technologies safer. A summary paper, , outlines the key issues discussed and opportunities for action.Virtual reality users are usually isolated by the use of headsets, which can further exacerbate risks to children.> We know perpetrators will find any crack in platforms they can penetrate. There’s a huge amount of work to be done, but also a lot of “ knowledge we already have.>> Participant in WeProtect Global Alliance roundtable discussion on XR### Who is likely to be impacted?Children form a significant portion of the XR (Extended Reality) user base, with gaming becoming an integral part of their daily lives.  of children aged 7-10 revealed that they feel safest on private messaging apps and gaming platforms, even though these are often areas where online abuse occurs.Currently, many children worldwide cannot access these emerging technologies due to high costs, limited high-speed internet access, and the necessary hardware requirements. However, XR technologies are expected to become more prevalent in the near future as they become more affordable and accessible.#### Extended Reality (XR) statistics**$1.1 trillion** – the predicted global XR market by 2030Source: **75% of people** believe children are at significant risk of sexual abuse when using VR technologySource: **Four in 10** parents (41%) say they don’t know much, or anything, about the metaverse. Over half of children (53%) say the same.Source: ## The response: addressing the threatKey measures that can be taken by taken by a range of actors to prevent harm to children as access to XR technologies include:### Education and awareness- Equip young people and parents with information about the potential hazards and ways to avoid them, including through school education.### Technology- Prevent children from accessing inappropriate content, via user authentication, age restrictions, age assurance mechanisms and parental controls- Provide advice and education for children and their caregivers about managing risks- Allow users to block or otherwise restrict interactions with other users- Ensure content moderation systems are in place and work across platforms.- Adopt Safety by Design approaches with children in mind and address different types of risk to children.### Legislation- Ensure XR risks are covered in existing or new legislation and polic ~~.~~ y### Data and research- Investment in research and development is urgently required to support criminal investigation and prosecutions.### Involvement of children and young people- Include children and young people in product development and testing to support Safety by Design## Resources]( Report summarising key themes and insights from a roundtable with members, focusing on potential harms in XR environments and current mitigations, including robust content moderation, age assurance, user authentication, Safety by Design and collective social responsibility.]( WeProtect Global Alliance Executive Director Iain Drennan reflects on how without coordinated action, virtual reality risks to children will only worsen.]( WeProtect Global Alliance intelligence briefing, developed by Professor Emma Barrett OBE from The University of Manchester, aims to provide an overview of the latest information and trends on eXtended Reality (XR) and its potential impact on child sexual exploitation and abuse online.]( Our Global Threat Assessment report aims to encourage evidence-based action, recommend solutions and measures based on the evidence, and highlight opportunities to prevent abuse before it happens.## What our members are doingBelow are just some of the ways our members are working to protect children and young people from potential Extended Reality threats.]( The research included interviews and focus groups with experts in emerging technologies, a literature review, primary data collection through visits to virtual reality platforms and additional desk-based research.Based on the findings, and with support from Limina Immersive, the NSPCC has developed recommendations for government and industry on how to ensure children can remain safe in the metaverse.]( The report considers both positive and negative effects that virtual environments could have on children; the drivers of and predictions for the growth of the metaverse; and the regulatory and policy challenges posed by the metaverse.

From unprecedented applications in healthcare, education, and training to profound shifts in social interactions and the world of design, VR continues to redefine the boundaries of what’s possible. In this blog, we’ll look at some of the VR trends of 2023, and offer some predictions that might shape the next decade of virtual exploration.### Top Trends in 2023Technology in gaming consistently breaks new ground. In 2023, VR gaming was no exception. The visuals in VR games have attained a level of sophistication that’s truly mesmerising, bolstering the sense of immersion. Game designers haven’t rested on their laurels; they keep exploring the nuances of the VR medium to astonishing effect. However, at , our attention was predominantly captured by VR’s increasing role in emulating real-world scenarios, such as in professional contexts or product visualisations. The corporate world is slowly waking up to the advantages VR can offer, particularly regarding training simulations.The software aspect of VR has also seen remarkable advancements. Companies like Unity and Unreal have provided VR developers with increasingly sophisticated tools, simplifying the creation process. The rise of OpenXR is also helpful, enabling software compatibility across a variety of headsets.### Predictions for the Near FutureThe hardware evolution isn’t slowing down. In the upcoming year, we’re anticipating several  releases, with  being particularly anticipated. The trajectory is clear: increasingly powerful capabilities will be packaged in sleeker, lighter designs. At Mersus, our focus has been on pioneering apps that favour hand tracking over traditional controllers, especially for mobile headsets. The market still has a limited number of entities producing VR training modules for untethered headsets utilising hand tracking. The question on our minds is: Will 2024 witness a more widespread transition to this format?### Immersive ExperiencesAs VR technology continues to advance, the line between the virtual and the real is becoming increasingly blurred. Future VR isn’t just about visuals; it aims to encompass all of our senses. This means that upcoming VR platforms are not only focusing on improving visual fidelity but are also diving into areas like haptic feedback, 3D audio, and even scent emulation. Such hyper-realistic simulations will do more than just entertain; they’ll challenge our very perceptions of reality. By engaging multiple senses, they can evoke stronger emotions, create more memorable experiences, and even be used in therapeutic settings. As we look ahead, the potential for VR to create entirely immersive worlds is both exciting and limitless.!### Integration with ARThe convergence of Augmented Reality (AR) and VR is shaping up to be one of the most significant technological junctions in recent times. While VR offers a complete immersion in a digital world, AR overlays virtual elements onto our physical surroundings. The blending of these two realms promises a seamless continuum where users can transition smoothly between fully immersive and augmented experiences. This integration has the potential to revolutionise industries. For instance, in the realm of design and architecture, professionals could switch between altering a virtual model in VR and visualising those changes in a real-world context through AR. Similarly, in the entertainment sector, gamers could transition between playing in a fully immersive world and having game elements interact with their physical surroundings. The intertwining of AR and VR not only opens up new avenues for user experiences but also sets the stage for the development of hardware and software that cater to this hybrid reality.### AI Integrations with VRArtificial Intelligence (AI) and VR together promise a dynamic synergy. One of the most promising uses of AI in VR is the customisation of user experiences through smart algorithms.\\\\xa0 This is most relevant to Mersus Technologies in the power AI can bring to tailoring a trainee on the  platform’s learning journey.Moreover, AI’s capability to procedurally generate VR environments can lead to expansive, intricately detailed landscapes. Such environments could be constantly evolving, offering unpredictability and novelty to users. Additionally, integrating AI can infuse Non-Playable Characters (NPCs) with a semblance of autonomy, making them more nuanced and engaging for users.The landscape of Virtual Reality is continuously evolving, presenting opportunities that refine our interaction with digital environments. As we stand at the threshold of further advancements in VR, it’s clear that the industry is charting a course towards even more immersive and nuanced experiences. Reflecting on the strides and innovations of recent years offers perspective on this progression. The future of VR promises enhanced realism and immersion, bridging the divide between the tangible and the virtual. As we move forward, the unfolding developments in Virtual Reality are sure to be both intriguing and impactful.### Consult, Design, Develop, Deploy & Analyse                   ## Related Posts]( “Meet Mersus” – Mersus’ inaugural official video biography]( Mar 2024]( the Synergy of AI and VR – AI and VR Integration]( Jul 2023]( for Training in Ireland (Demo)]( Feb 2019]( Evolution of Virtual Reality: Past, Present, and Future]( Mar 2025]( Training and Remote Work: A Game-Changer for Global Teams]( Mar 2025]( Stories of Virtual Reality Training]( Feb 2025]( Reality in Healthcare: Enhancing Patient Care]( Mar 2025]( Tracking: Elevating VR Training to the Next Level]( Feb 2025]( Learning: Why It Works]( Apr 2025]( Reality Glove – Interview with Dr Brendan O’Flynn (Demo)]( Jan 2018]( Reality The Game Changer for High-Risk Industries]( Mar 2025\\'}]', name='web_search_tool', call_id='call_a4KU8BXLdz8u57sYxvrs63bs', is_error=False), FunctionExecutionResult(content='[{\\'title\\': \\'The Top 5 VR Innovations Unveiled at CES 2023 - XpertVR 2025\\', \\'url\\': \\'https://xpertvr.ca/the-top-5-vr-innovations-unveiled-at-ces-2023/\\', \\'markdown\\': \"!![]( White decorative]( to content]( #1 - Magic LeapFor years, Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) have been on the brink of revolutionizing technology as we know it.

This milestone year in the evolution of augmented and virtual reality technology has been marked by significant product launches, technological advancements, and industry shifts.While we won’t be able to tell you which VR headset to buy in 2023 (that is always down to a matter of personal preference), in this post we’ll delve into these developments, specifically spotlighting some of the headlining headsets that have helped to redefine the shape of the AR and VR market, and that have set us up for what will be a breakthrough year for XR in 2024. And who knows, maybe reading this analysis will provide you with several reasons to get a VR headset, if you don’t already own one.## Headset Launches2023 was an amazing year for hardware enthusiasts, with dozens of exciting headset releases and announcements. We’ll dive into some of our top picks of the year.![]( HTC VIVE XR EliteThe VIVE XR Elite was introduced by HTC at CES 2023 at the beginning of the year. The device was really one of the first mainstream consumer XR brands to mark the shift towards what the industry is currently referring to as “mixed reality.” Priced at $1,099, the headset stands out for its lightweight and compact design, making it one of the most comfortable VR headsets available.It features a screen resolution of 2K pixels per eye (4K combined), a 110-degree field of view, and a 90Hz refresh rate, offering users a finely tuned viewing experience. Additionally, the VIVE XR Elite boasts 128GB of memory and 12GB of RAM.Going first is never easy, especially when an entire industry is watching and waiting to see what bar you are setting in order to fine tune their own offerings. However, despite the VIVE XR Elite coming out almost a year ago now, the headset is still one of the best mixed reality devices you can get at the moment, and an extremely solid contender within the standalone headset market. Plus, combining the device with VIVE’s enormous ecosystem of other hardware/software offerings and PC VR compatibility, it’s likely this device will still be the headset of choice for many this time next year.![]( **Apple Vision Pro**A solid picture of what Apple\\\\\\'s foray into the AR/VR domain is going to look like finally materialized this year, with the company announcing the Vision Pro, a spatial computing device set to ship in early 2024. Priced at $3,499, the headset features dual 4K displays, gesture tracking, and both an M2 chip and the new R1 chip that has been specifically designed for real-time processing of the real world. The Vision Pro packs an ultra-high-resolution display system with 23 million pixels across two displays (for reference, a 4K TV features more than 8 million pixels).As well as an entirely new device from Apple, the company has also built its new VisionOS, the brand new operating system on which the Vision Pro will run. Through a combination of some incredible hardware and a new powerful operating system, the Vision Pro has been designed to give users as lag-free an experience as possible, which in turn should help to tackle one of VR’s most common problems – motion sickness.Furthermore, in addition to the physical HMD and a new OS, the launch of the Vision Pro demonstrates Apple’s commitment to AR technology. The company rarely introduces a product without a viable use case, and its introduction of a new form factor highlights Apple’s bullish position on spatial computing as a new tool through which it can bring more value to users.The device is  to become available in March 2024, however this is yet to be confirmed by Apple themselves. Some industry commentators are  that the Vision Pro is the best headset that they have ever tried. Regardless of your opinion on Apple, it is hard to argue that the company’s entry into the XR market this year was probably the single most anticipated move by any tech company in the AR/VR space ever, and expectations are certainly running high for the upcoming headset.![]( **Meta Quest 3**Released in September at a price of $499.99, the Meta Quest 3 set a new standard in the XR headset market. Building on the success of the Quest 2, Meta’s Quest 3 device introduced a slimmer and lighter design, enhancing comfort for extended use. A significant 30% increase in visual resolution and a 40% louder audio range compared to its predecessor also marked major improvements.The Quest 3 was also the first device to feature Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 Snapdragon platform (more on this in a bit), coupled with 8GB of RAM, doubling the graphical power of the Quest 3 when compared with the Quest 2.Marketed as a “mixed reality\" device (for clarification on the terms, see our last blog post on the subject), the Quest 3’s AR passthrough capabilities on a VR headset have allowed creators and game developers to come up with entirely new ways in which users can interact with their surroundings. These advancements not only improve the user experience but also push the boundaries of what\\\\\\'s possible in virtual and mixed reality environments.![]( **Bigscreen Beyond**Also released in September 2023, Bigscreen Beyond is a groundbreaking VR headset, noted for being the world’s smallest, weighing just 127 grams, yet still packing a punch. Priced at $999, it features MicroOLED displays and advanced pancake optics, offering a high resolution of 5120 x 2560 pixels and up to 90 Hz refresh rates. Bigscreen Beyond\\\\\\'s slim profile is designed for comfort and fully supports VR games on Steam with compatibility to SteamVR tracking.The headset looks like something straight out of a futuristic sci-fi movie, and could well be paving the way for a future of small, slimline VR headset form factors. If this is how headsets look in 5-10 years time, we wouldn’t be disappointed. But the beauty is, you don’t have to wait half a decade to look like you’re already in Ready Player One - you can order your own Bigscreen Beyond device today!![]( **Lynx R1**The Lynx R1 only came out last month, but there have been enough demos of the headset for the market to know that Lynx is a serious player when it comes to functional XR hardware. The R1 is a groundbreaking mixed reality headset that stands out for its affordability and innovation. Priced at $849 for the standard edition, it offers a blend of VR and AR with a unique \"True Mixed Reality\" experience.The device prioritizes user experience, data sovereignty, and privacy, requiring no Facebook account or cloud connection, and allows for complete offline operation. Featuring the Snapdragon XR2 Gen 1 processor and \"4-fold catadioptric\" lenses, the R1 ensures a slimmer design and balanced weight distribution, making it a significant addition to 2023’s lineup of new XR headsets.The beautiful thing about the Lynx R1 is that it is truly helping to change people’s lives—for example, by helping those who are visually impaired to see more of the world—which alone is reason enough to include it in this blog post. You can  on stage with Chris McNally at AWE USA earlier this year highlighting the R1’s suitability as an assistive technology device.![]( **Varjo XR-4 Series**Only very recently announced (last week!) was Varjo’s latest lineup of headsets, the XR-4 series, which includes the XR-4, XR-4 Focal Edition and XR-4 Secure Edition. This most recent announcement from the company, whose headsets are known for their high-fidelity visuals and industrial-grade build, represents a significant leap in XR technology.Varjo\\\\\\'s headsets are a go-to choice for professionals in various fields such as design, engineering, and simulation training. The Varjo XR-4 Series seems like it will be setting a very high bar in the professional XR headset market, thanks to unparalleled visual fidelity and robust features. The company’s technology always seems to exemplify the power and potential of XR for transforming professional workflows, training, and research. However, this means that the devices come with quite a hefty price tag.The XR-4 series starts at $3,990, so definitely not the sort of device that users buying on a budget would be considering. However, with specs that  device (which also has its own hefty price tag), it will still have an appeal to professional consumers. Although initial availability for the XR-4 series will be reserved for enterprise purchases only, Varjo is offering a waitlist for those consumers that are looking for the absolute best level of visual fidelity in their XR experiences.![]( What Lies AheadThis review is by no means an exhaustive list, and there have been many other amazing headset launches and announcements that have taken place this year. However, there simply isn’t space to cover every single one of them in this post. But that in itself should be a very positive indicator for the XR industry, in that there is now so much choice when it comes to VR/MR devices, it signals that the industry is continuing to mature. Growth in demand from both consumers and the enterprise is helping to drive innovation across the sector, which can only be a good thing for the future of augmented, virtual and mixed reality technologies.Part two of this series will take a look at some of the other XR technologies that have been announced this year that have made a huge impact on the progress of the industry as a whole. While it is unknown exactly what new devices and headsets will arrive in 2024, one thing is for sure - you’ll be able to experience the latest in this cutting edge XR technology and get hands on with the latest VR and AR devices at AWE’s events next year.Super Early Bird tickets for AWE USA in Long Beach, California are still on sale for just $695, so make sure you’re a part of what will be the most exciting XR event of 2024.Plus, if you’re interested in participating in other ways, whether speaking, exhibiting, sponsoring, or joining AWE’s enterprise program, there are plenty of ways to  in next year’s events.Share This Article### Recent Post11 Sep 2025AWE Talks: Elevating Storytelling to StorylivingAWE USA 2025byMike Boland]( Sep 2025AWE Talks: Unlocking AI By Linking it to the Real WorldAWE USA 2025byMike Boland]( Sep 2025AWE Talks: A Bushel of Bushnell\\\\\\'sAWE USA 2025byMike Boland]( Sep 2025AWE Talks: Elevating Storytelling to StorylivingAWE USA 2025byMike Boland]( Sep 2025AWE Talks: Unlocking AI By Linking it to the Real WorldAWE USA 2025byMike Boland]( Sep 2025AWE Talks: A Bushel of Bushnell\\\\\\'sAWE USA 2025byMike Boland]( Sep 2025AWE Talks: Elevating Storytelling to StorylivingAWE USA 2025byMike Boland]( Sep 2025AWE Talks: Unlocking AI By Linking it to the Real WorldAWE USA 2025byMike Boland]( 1- 2- 3### Cookie settingsWe use cookies to provide you with the best possible experience.

This shift mirrors the historical trajectory of the telephone, which transformed from a stationary household device to a mobile, personal essential. As AR/MR devices become more portable, advanced, sleek, affordable and socially acceptable, they are poised to transition into personal, everyday accessories akin to smartphones.In fact, the desire for increased portability is so pronounced that consumers are willing to pay an average of 20 percent premium for devices usable outside of home. Locations that can command relatively higher price premiums compared to home are arenas or concert venues, common shopping areas/centers and social establishments such as cafes and restaurants.#### Percentage points difference in price\\\\xa0willing to payThree quarters of consumers expect to be able to use AR/MR headsets on-the-go in the next five years.Price premium (relative to other locations)Select allAt home: -8%On a plane: 18%While commuting: 21%At the workplace: 25%In cafes or restaurants: 27%In shopping areas/stores: 28%In arenas/concert venues: 33%No data to display.Desired locations to use AR/MR headsets in the next five years\"I think (bringing XR devices outside-of-home) is more important because at home there\\\\\\'s only so much that you can do. It\\\\\\'d be great if I could bring it outside. For example, bringing it to vacations, to other countries.\"- XR user, Japan## 3. As AR technology advances in adapting to geospatial surroundings, the range of experiences will become more diverse and demanding on 5GAs the industry advances, we foresee a three-stage transition for consumer AR experiences over the next five years.Initially, basic AR experiences, such as social, and informational applications, will become widely available to consumers. This stage has already commenced and will continue to evolve in the coming one to two years. This is followed by the second stage during which more location-based and geospatially aware experiences will become widely accessible to consumers thanks to the expected advancement in geospatial AR technology. Finally, more advanced, and native experiences will begin to emerge and gradually become widely available to consumers. For instance, consumers will be able to enjoy mixed reality cinematic experiences anywhere and have 3D digital exercise companions during workouts.As AR experiences evolve, the devices available to consumers will also undergo a transformation. This evolution will commence with smartphones dominating the initial stage, followed by lightweight, portable AR/MR devices acting as companions to smartphones, enabling outside-the-home and on-the-go use. Eventually, standalone AR/MR devices will emerge to facilitate native and more advanced experiences.!## 4. Bystander privacy still looms large, hindering device adoptionWhile early adopters have shown interest in XR, the adoption among the general population still lags. This slow uptake is attributed to a variety of factors, including technological challenges, device design, social acceptance, alongside privacy concerns.Social acceptance plays a crucial role in influencing consumer adoption. Over 60 percent express reluctance to use AR/MR devices publicly unless they are visually appealing. Additionally, more than half are apprehensive about potential health and safety risks. Another significant aspect of social acceptance is bystander privacy, meaning consumers are exposed to others taking pictures or videos with AR/MR devices. While fewer consumers, around 2 out of 10, show concern about being captured by others using AR/MR devices as bystanders, many more, around 6 out of 10, show concern if these pictures and videos are shared with others, with or without their consent.The amassed impact of bystander privacy issues influences consumers\\\\\\' willingness to adopt AR/MR devices. This becomes evident when examining the share of consumers intending to purchase an AR/MR device. Notably, for those who are concerned about bystander privacy, the intention to adopt is 18 percentage points lower than for those who are not concerned.#### Bystander privacy concern - impact on AR device adoptionUsers who are not concernedUsers who are concernedSelect allz-empty-common-0No data to display.Share of users who will buy an AR/MR device during the first year\"Previous headsets made people look stupid and people may look at you weirdly if you wear AR glasses.\"- XR user, the US## Implications on the 5G network![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns=\\\\\\' viewBox=\\\\\\'0 0 16 9\\\\\\'%3E%3C/svg%3E)The evolution of the AR market will require efforts from a range of ecosystem players to drive both technological development and consumer adoption. Collaboration within the ecosystem will be essential to propel AR technology to its full potential, focusing on diverse areas such as improving connectivity, ensuring seamless transitions between devices, improving application and content relevance, addressing privacy concerns, and shaping the societal acceptance of AR/MR devices.As portable AR/MR devices, likely in glasses form, gain popularity and social acceptance for everyday use, their reliability and utility in various contexts will increasingly hinge on network and cellular connectivity. Network infrastructure must be optimized for widespread usage outside of home and on the go. Wide area connectivity or 5G hotspots will be vital in high-traffic locations such as airports, train/subway stations, arenas/concert venues, stores or shopping areas, social establishments such as cafes and restaurants, or while commuting.On the other hand, increased AR adoption and the use of smartphone-connected portable AR/MR devices will also present new revenue opportunities for communications service providers (CSPs) in both consumer and developer markets. For example, CSPs can offer higher tethering allowances for AR/MR devices and premium plans with quality of service (QoS) differentiation in high-traffic locations for consumers. Simultaneously, they can provide developers with network APIs optimized for XR traffic demands.#### What will AR development look like in the near future?![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns=\\\\\\' viewBox=\\\\\\'0 0 16 9\\\\\\'%3E%3C/svg%3E)## Methodology#### Qualitative research:22 in-depth interviews were conducted between April and June 2023 with 12 current AR/VR users, 7 industry experts and 3 XR startup companies: TagSpace, forwARdgame and EyecandyLab. Interviewees were located in the US, Japan, South Korea and Germany.#### Quantitative research:An online survey was fielded between July and August in 2023 in 10 markets. The sample consists of 10,000 early adopters aged 15 to 69, with 1,000 from each market, who use smartphone AR apps and/or VR/AR/MR headsets/glasses at least every other week or plan to do so in the next five years. The sample represents 280 million early adopters in the markets surveyed. While early adopters are a small fraction of consumers globally, their early adopter profile makes these individuals important when exploring how wider groups of consumers might use these technologies in the future. The respondents were asked a range of questions about their current usage, the perceived benefits, challenges,\\\\u202ffuture adoption intention, and expectations around XR-powered experiences in the next five years.!## Meet our authors!#### Huani YaoHuani is an experienced consumer researcher with more than 15 years of experience in studying consumers’ values, behaviors, and attitudes toward technology.

This includes:- Virtual Reality (VR), which usually involves the user wearing a headset that displays a simulation of the real world- Augmented Reality (AR), which enhances the real-world environment by overlaying digital elements- Mixed Reality (MR), which integrates elements of VR and AR, to create a blended experience where the virtual and physical interact seamlessly.Although XR technologies have existed for decades, there has been a surge in interest, investment and availability in recent years, especially in workplaces and consumer leisure sectors. The global market for XR is forecasted to surpass $1.1 trillion by 2030.Augmented reality content for mobile phones is already widely available for consumers to use in app stores like Google Play and the Apple App store, Bespoke platforms are also being developed in industrial and workplace settings. Virtual reality content is available in various forms including gaming and education platforms and often includes use of a headset.The emergence of Extended Reality (XR) technologies - YouTubeWeProtect Global Alliance210 subscribersWeProtect Global AllianceSearchWatch laterShareCopy linkInfoShoppingTap to unmuteIf playback doesn't begin shortly, try restarting your device.Full screen is unavailable.

Unfortunately, as with any emerging technology there is a risk that offenders may use these new environments to exploit children.The Alliance’s  highlighted the risks posed to child safety, including opportunities for offenders to access victims, distribute child sexual abuse material, simulate abuse of virtual children, and use haptics to mimic real-world sensations like movement and force. Predators can also exploit ‘off-platforming’, where they move communication from XR environments to other platforms to groom children.In May 2024, we facilitated a roundtable discussion with leading experts to discuss key risks, challenges and opportunities to make the metaverse and technologies safer. A summary paper, , outlines the key issues discussed and opportunities for action.Virtual reality users are usually isolated by the use of headsets, which can further exacerbate risks to children.> We know perpetrators will find any crack in platforms they can penetrate. There’s a huge amount of work to be done, but also a lot of “ knowledge we already have.>> Participant in WeProtect Global Alliance roundtable discussion on XR### Who is likely to be impacted?Children form a significant portion of the XR (Extended Reality) user base, with gaming becoming an integral part of their daily lives.  of children aged 7-10 revealed that they feel safest on private messaging apps and gaming platforms, even though these are often areas where online abuse occurs.Currently, many children worldwide cannot access these emerging technologies due to high costs, limited high-speed internet access, and the necessary hardware requirements. However, XR technologies are expected to become more prevalent in the near future as they become more affordable and accessible.#### Extended Reality (XR) statistics**$1.1 trillion** – the predicted global XR market by 2030Source: **75% of people** believe children are at significant risk of sexual abuse when using VR technologySource: **Four in 10** parents (41%) say they don’t know much, or anything, about the metaverse.

This milestone year in the evolution of augmented and virtual reality technology has been marked by significant product launches, technological advancements, and industry shifts.While we won’t be able to tell you which VR headset to buy in 2023 (that is always down to a matter of personal preference), in this post we’ll delve into these developments, specifically spotlighting some of the headlining headsets that have helped to redefine the shape of the AR and VR market, and that have set us up for what will be a breakthrough year for XR in 2024. And who knows, maybe reading this analysis will provide you with several reasons to get a VR headset, if you don’t already own one.## Headset Launches2023 was an amazing year for hardware enthusiasts, with dozens of exciting headset releases and announcements. We’ll dive into some of our top picks of the year.![]( HTC VIVE XR EliteThe VIVE XR Elite was introduced by HTC at CES 2023 at the beginning of the year. The device was really one of the first mainstream consumer XR brands to mark the shift towards what the industry is currently referring to as “mixed reality.” Priced at $1,099, the headset stands out for its lightweight and compact design, making it one of the most comfortable VR headsets available.It features a screen resolution of 2K pixels per eye (4K combined), a 110-degree field of view, and a 90Hz refresh rate, offering users a finely tuned viewing experience. Additionally, the VIVE XR Elite boasts 128GB of memory and 12GB of RAM.Going first is never easy, especially when an entire industry is watching and waiting to see what bar you are setting in order to fine tune their own offerings. However, despite the VIVE XR Elite coming out almost a year ago now, the headset is still one of the best mixed reality devices you can get at the moment, and an extremely solid contender within the standalone headset market. Plus, combining the device with VIVE’s enormous ecosystem of other hardware/software offerings and PC VR compatibility, it’s likely this device will still be the headset of choice for many this time next year.![]( **Apple Vision Pro**A solid picture of what Apple\\'s foray into the AR/VR domain is going to look like finally materialized this year, with the company announcing the Vision Pro, a spatial computing device set to ship in early 2024. Priced at $3,499, the headset features dual 4K displays, gesture tracking, and both an M2 chip and the new R1 chip that has been specifically designed for real-time processing of the real world. The Vision Pro packs an ultra-high-resolution display system with 23 million pixels across two displays (for reference, a 4K TV features more than 8 million pixels).As well as an entirely new device from Apple, the company has also built its new VisionOS, the brand new operating system on which the Vision Pro will run. Through a combination of some incredible hardware and a new powerful operating system, the Vision Pro has been designed to give users as lag-free an experience as possible, which in turn should help to tackle one of VR’s most common problems – motion sickness.Furthermore, in addition to the physical HMD and a new OS, the launch of the Vision Pro demonstrates Apple’s commitment to AR technology. The company rarely introduces a product without a viable use case, and its introduction of a new form factor highlights Apple’s bullish position on spatial computing as a new tool through which it can bring more value to users.The device is  to become available in March 2024, however this is yet to be confirmed by Apple themselves. Some industry commentators are  that the Vision Pro is the best headset that they have ever tried. Regardless of your opinion on Apple, it is hard to argue that the company’s entry into the XR market this year was probably the single most anticipated move by any tech company in the AR/VR space ever, and expectations are certainly running high for the upcoming headset.![]( **Meta Quest 3**Released in September at a price of $499.99, the Meta Quest 3 set a new standard in the XR headset market. Building on the success of the Quest 2, Meta’s Quest 3 device introduced a slimmer and lighter design, enhancing comfort for extended use. A significant 30% increase in visual resolution and a 40% louder audio range compared to its predecessor also marked major improvements.The Quest 3 was also the first device to feature Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 Snapdragon platform (more on this in a bit), coupled with 8GB of RAM, doubling the graphical power of the Quest 3 when compared with the Quest 2.Marketed as a “mixed reality\" device (for clarification on the terms, see our last blog post on the subject), the Quest 3’s AR passthrough capabilities on a VR headset have allowed creators and game developers to come up with entirely new ways in which users can interact with their surroundings. These advancements not only improve the user experience but also push the boundaries of what\\'s possible in virtual and mixed reality environments.![]( **Bigscreen Beyond**Also released in September 2023, Bigscreen Beyond is a groundbreaking VR headset, noted for being the world’s smallest, weighing just 127 grams, yet still packing a punch. Priced at $999, it features MicroOLED displays and advanced pancake optics, offering a high resolution of 5120 x 2560 pixels and up to 90 Hz refresh rates. Bigscreen Beyond\\'s slim profile is designed for comfort and fully supports VR games on Steam with compatibility to SteamVR tracking.The headset looks like something straight out of a futuristic sci-fi movie, and could well be paving the way for a future of small, slimline VR headset form factors. If this is how headsets look in 5-10 years time, we wouldn’t be disappointed. But the beauty is, you don’t have to wait half a decade to look like you’re already in Ready Player One - you can order your own Bigscreen Beyond device today!![]( **Lynx R1**The Lynx R1 only came out last month, but there have been enough demos of the headset for the market to know that Lynx is a serious player when it comes to functional XR hardware. The R1 is a groundbreaking mixed reality headset that stands out for its affordability and innovation. Priced at $849 for the standard edition, it offers a blend of VR and AR with a unique \"True Mixed Reality\" experience.The device prioritizes user experience, data sovereignty, and privacy, requiring no Facebook account or cloud connection, and allows for complete offline operation. Featuring the Snapdragon XR2 Gen 1 processor and \"4-fold catadioptric\" lenses, the R1 ensures a slimmer design and balanced weight distribution, making it a significant addition to 2023’s lineup of new XR headsets.The beautiful thing about the Lynx R1 is that it is truly helping to change people’s lives—for example, by helping those who are visually impaired to see more of the world—which alone is reason enough to include it in this blog post. You can  on stage with Chris McNally at AWE USA earlier this year highlighting the R1’s suitability as an assistive technology device.![]( **Varjo XR-4 Series**Only very recently announced (last week!) was Varjo’s latest lineup of headsets, the XR-4 series, which includes the XR-4, XR-4 Focal Edition and XR-4 Secure Edition. This most recent announcement from the company, whose headsets are known for their high-fidelity visuals and industrial-grade build, represents a significant leap in XR technology.Varjo\\'s headsets are a go-to choice for professionals in various fields such as design, engineering, and simulation training. The Varjo XR-4 Series seems like it will be setting a very high bar in the professional XR headset market, thanks to unparalleled visual fidelity and robust features. The company’s technology always seems to exemplify the power and potential of XR for transforming professional workflows, training, and research. However, this means that the devices come with quite a hefty price tag.The XR-4 series starts at $3,990, so definitely not the sort of device that users buying on a budget would be considering. However, with specs that  device (which also has its own hefty price tag), it will still have an appeal to professional consumers. Although initial availability for the XR-4 series will be reserved for enterprise purchases only, Varjo is offering a waitlist for those consumers that are looking for the absolute best level of visual fidelity in their XR experiences.![]( What Lies AheadThis review is by no means an exhaustive list, and there have been many other amazing headset launches and announcements that have taken place this year. However, there simply isn’t space to cover every single one of them in this post. But that in itself should be a very positive indicator for the XR industry, in that there is now so much choice when it comes to VR/MR devices, it signals that the industry is continuing to mature. Growth in demand from both consumers and the enterprise is helping to drive innovation across the sector, which can only be a good thing for the future of augmented, virtual and mixed reality technologies.Part two of this series will take a look at some of the other XR technologies that have been announced this year that have made a huge impact on the progress of the industry as a whole.

It transforms how consumers entertain, shop, socialize, and express art. It is pivotal across industries and is increasingly accessible to consumers via smartphone AR apps. However, challenges with current smartphone AR experiences, including limited applications and content, low immersion, physical discomfort, and social acceptance issues, hinder consumer adoption. Furthermore, consumer-friendly AR/MR devices remain scarce. Nonetheless, consumers consistently express interest in AR experiences, anticipating lightweight and portable AR/MR devices to become essential companions to smartphones.Extended reality (XR) refers to a range of technologies, including augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and mixed reality (MR), that combine physical and digital environments to create . Headsets, glasses as well as smartphones are the common devices used to bring these technologies to life.## Key findings#### Consumer AR – key insights with Jasmeet SethiEricsson ConsumerLab conducted extensive research across 10 global markets with current and prospective extended reality (XR) users, revealing four pivotal insights shaping consumer expectations and needs for augmented reality (AR) experiences over the next five years. Tune in and learn about the key insights and implications with Jasmeet Sethi, head of Ericsson ConsumerLab.Watch the video.![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns=\\' viewBox=\\'0 0 16 9\\'%3E%3C/svg%3E)]( 1. Consumers combining smartphones and AR devices will double in the next five yearsDespite low satisfaction with current smartphone AR experiences, those that combine smartphone and VR/AR/MR headsets/glasses tend to be happier. Over the next five years, the share of such combined use is projected to double. Furthermore, consumers expect lightweight and portable AR/MR devices becoming essential companions to smartphones.]( 2. Consumers are hungry for on-the-go AR devices and willing to pay 20 percent more for the portabilityToday, VR/AR/MR headsets/glasses are largely limited to home use, serving as shared household devices. However, three-quarters of consumers anticipate the availability of portable AR devices, likely in glasses form, for outside-of-home and on-the-go use in the next five years, expressing a willingness to pay a premium for such devices.]( 3. As AR technology advances in adapting to geospatial surroundings, the range of experiences will become more diverse and demanding on 5GCurrent consumer AR experiences center on information, navigation, and social AR filters. As geospatial AR technology progresses, the use case landscape will expand to include more diverse applications featuring precise location tracking and enhanced environmental awareness. Examples of such applications are AR sports viewing and concerts, public digital arts, and augmented tourist displays. This expansion will demand 5G networks to deliver consistent, real-time experiences.]( 4. Bystander privacy still looms large, hindering device adoptionBystander privacy, referring to consumers feeling exposed to others scanning them with AR devices, remains a critical concern among consumers, with 60 percent expressing apprehension globally. This worry significantly reduces the share of users intending to adopt AR devices by 18 percentage points.#### Augmented tomorrow: AR experiences beyond smartphones and AR filtersExploring consumer expectations and needs in an evolving XR landscape.]( 1. Consumers combining smartphones and AR devices will double in the next five yearsThe smartphone has become inseparable from consumers\\' lives, serving as an extension of their bodies. Its ubiquity makes it challenging for users to envision a replacement. While smartphones serve as the primary entry point for AR experiences, and consumer interest in AR experiences has been increasing steadily among 5G users in the past three years, overall satisfaction remains low, at only 42 percent, due to numerous limitations and challenges with current smartphone AR experiences, including limited applications, irrelevant content, small screens, arm fatigue, and low immersion.However, consumers who use both smartphone AR apps and VR/AR/MR headsets/glasses tend to be more satisfied with smartphone AR experiences, with almost half reporting content, about 10 percentage points higher than those who don’t use both. Today, about 1 out of 10 users utilize both smartphone AR and VR/AR/MR headsets/glasses, and this number is expected to double in the next five years. This highlights the undeniable importance of headsets/glasses in delivering comprehensive experiences alongside smartphones, despite ongoing challenges in achieving full consumer-friendliness.#### User groups - today versus in 5 years!Consumers expect AR/MR devices, likely in glasses form, to become companions to smartphones, with 62 percent expressing willingness to connect these devices to smartphones for elevated experiences, provided these devices will evolve and become compact, lightweight, and offer extended battery life.## 2. Consumers are hungry for on-the-go AR devices and willing to pay 20 percent more for the portabilityToday, VR/AR/MR headsets/glasses are predominantly used within homes and perceived as shared devices, with 64 percent of users reporting sharing their devices with household members. This highlights the current domestic and communal nature of such devices.However, as anticipation grows for the evolution and enhancement of AR/MR devices over the next five years, three-quarters of consumers express a desire to extend their usage beyond home settings. This shift mirrors the historical trajectory of the telephone, which transformed from a stationary household device to a mobile, personal essential. As AR/MR devices become more portable, advanced, sleek, affordable and socially acceptable, they are poised to transition into personal, everyday accessories akin to smartphones.In fact, the desire for increased portability is so pronounced that consumers are willing to pay an average of 20 percent premium for devices usable outside of home. Locations that can command relatively higher price premiums compared to home are arenas or concert venues, common shopping areas/centers and social establishments such as cafes and restaurants.#### Percentage points difference in price\\xa0willing to payThree quarters of consumers expect to be able to use AR/MR headsets on-the-go in the next five years.Price premium (relative to other locations)Select allAt home: -8%On a plane: 18%While commuting: 21%At the workplace: 25%In cafes or restaurants: 27%In shopping areas/stores: 28%In arenas/concert venues: 33%No data to display.Desired locations to use AR/MR headsets in the next five years\"I think (bringing XR devices outside-of-home) is more important because at home there\\'s only so much that you can do. It\\'d be great if I could bring it outside. For example, bringing it to vacations, to other countries.\"- XR user, Japan## 3. As AR technology advances in adapting to geospatial surroundings, the range of experiences will become more diverse and demanding on 5GAs the industry advances, we foresee a three-stage transition for consumer AR experiences over the next five years.Initially, basic AR experiences, such as social, and informational applications, will become widely available to consumers. This stage has already commenced and will continue to evolve in the coming one to two years. This is followed by the second stage during which more location-based and geospatially aware experiences will become widely accessible to consumers thanks to the expected advancement in geospatial AR technology. Finally, more advanced, and native experiences will begin to emerge and gradually become widely available to consumers. For instance, consumers will be able to enjoy mixed reality cinematic experiences anywhere and have 3D digital exercise companions during workouts.As AR experiences evolve, the devices available to consumers will also undergo a transformation. This evolution will commence with smartphones dominating the initial stage, followed by lightweight, portable AR/MR devices acting as companions to smartphones, enabling outside-the-home and on-the-go use. Eventually, standalone AR/MR devices will emerge to facilitate native and more advanced experiences.!## 4. Bystander privacy still looms large, hindering device adoptionWhile early adopters have shown interest in XR, the adoption among the general population still lags. This slow uptake is attributed to a variety of factors, including technological challenges, device design, social acceptance, alongside privacy concerns.Social acceptance plays a crucial role in influencing consumer adoption. Over 60 percent express reluctance to use AR/MR devices publicly unless they are visually appealing. Additionally, more than half are apprehensive about potential health and safety risks. Another significant aspect of social acceptance is bystander privacy, meaning consumers are exposed to others taking pictures or videos with AR/MR devices. While fewer consumers, around 2 out of 10, show concern about being captured by others using AR/MR devices as bystanders, many more, around 6 out of 10, show concern if these pictures and videos are shared with others, with or without their consent.The amassed impact of bystander privacy issues influences consumers\\' willingness to adopt AR/MR devices. This becomes evident when examining the share of consumers intending to purchase an AR/MR device. Notably, for those who are concerned about bystander privacy, the intention to adopt is 18 percentage points lower than for those who are not concerned.#### Bystander privacy concern - impact on AR device adoptionUsers who are not concernedUsers who are concernedSelect allz-empty-common-0No data to display.Share of users who will buy an AR/MR device during the first year\"Previous headsets made people look stupid and people may look at you weirdly if you wear AR glasses.\"- XR user, the US## Implications on the 5G network![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns=\\' viewBox=\\'0 0 16 9\\'%3E%3C/svg%3E)The evolution of the AR market will require efforts from a range of ecosystem players to drive both technological development and consumer adoption. Collaboration within the ecosystem will be essential to propel AR technology to its full potential, focusing on diverse areas such as improving connectivity, ensuring seamless transitions between devices, improving application and content relevance, addressing privacy concerns, and shaping the societal acceptance of AR/MR devices.As portable AR/MR devices, likely in glasses form, gain popularity and social acceptance for everyday use, their reliability and utility in various contexts will increasingly hinge on network and cellular connectivity. Network infrastructure must be optimized for widespread usage outside of home and on the go. Wide area connectivity or 5G hotspots will be vital in high-traffic locations such as airports, train/subway stations, arenas/concert venues, stores or shopping areas, social establishments such as cafes and restaurants, or while commuting.On the other hand, increased AR adoption and the use of smartphone-connected portable AR/MR devices will also present new revenue opportunities for communications service providers (CSPs) in both consumer and developer markets. For example, CSPs can offer higher tethering allowances for AR/MR devices and premium plans with quality of service (QoS) differentiation in high-traffic locations for consumers. Simultaneously, they can provide developers with network APIs optimized for XR traffic demands.#### What will AR development look like in the near future?![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns=\\' viewBox=\\'0 0 16 9\\'%3E%3C/svg%3E)## Methodology#### Qualitative research:22 in-depth interviews were conducted between April and June 2023 with 12 current AR/VR users, 7 industry experts and 3 XR startup companies: TagSpace, forwARdgame and EyecandyLab. Interviewees were located in the US, Japan, South Korea and Germany.#### Quantitative research:An online survey was fielded between July and August in 2023 in 10 markets. The sample consists of 10,000 early adopters aged 15 to 69, with 1,000 from each market, who use smartphone AR apps and/or VR/AR/MR headsets/glasses at least every other week or plan to do so in the next five years. The sample represents 280 million early adopters in the markets surveyed. While early adopters are a small fraction of consumers globally, their early adopter profile makes these individuals important when exploring how wider groups of consumers might use these technologies in the future. The respondents were asked a range of questions about their current usage, the perceived benefits, challenges,\\u202ffuture adoption intention, and expectations around XR-powered experiences in the next five years.!## Meet our authors!#### Huani YaoHuani is an experienced consumer researcher with more than 15 years of experience in studying consumers’ values, behaviors, and attitudes toward technology.

This includes:- Virtual Reality (VR), which usually involves the user wearing a headset that displays a simulation of the real world- Augmented Reality (AR), which enhances the real-world environment by overlaying digital elements- Mixed Reality (MR), which integrates elements of VR and AR, to create a blended experience where the virtual and physical interact seamlessly.Although XR technologies have existed for decades, there has been a surge in interest, investment and availability in recent years, especially in workplaces and consumer leisure sectors. The global market for XR is forecasted to surpass $1.1 trillion by 2030.Augmented reality content for mobile phones is already widely available for consumers to use in app stores like Google Play and the Apple App store, Bespoke platforms are also being developed in industrial and workplace settings. Virtual reality content is available in various forms including gaming and education platforms and often includes use of a headset.The emergence of Extended Reality (XR) technologies - YouTubeWeProtect Global Alliance210 subscribersWeProtect Global AllianceSearchWatch laterShareCopy linkInfoShoppingTap to unmuteIf playback doesn\\'t begin shortly, try restarting your device.Full screen is unavailable.

Unfortunately, as with any emerging technology there is a risk that offenders may use these new environments to exploit children.The Alliance’s  highlighted the risks posed to child safety, including opportunities for offenders to access victims, distribute child sexual abuse material, simulate abuse of virtual children, and use haptics to mimic real-world sensations like movement and force. Predators can also exploit ‘off-platforming’, where they move communication from XR environments to other platforms to groom children.In May 2024, we facilitated a roundtable discussion with leading experts to discuss key risks, challenges and opportunities to make the metaverse and technologies safer. A summary paper, , outlines the key issues discussed and opportunities for action.Virtual reality users are usually isolated by the use of headsets, which can further exacerbate risks to children.> We know perpetrators will find any crack in platforms they can penetrate. There’s a huge amount of work to be done, but also a lot of “ knowledge we already have.>> Participant in WeProtect Global Alliance roundtable discussion on XR### Who is likely to be impacted?Children form a significant portion of the XR (Extended Reality) user base, with gaming becoming an integral part of their daily lives.  of children aged 7-10 revealed that they feel safest on private messaging apps and gaming platforms, even though these are often areas where online abuse occurs.Currently, many children worldwide cannot access these emerging technologies due to high costs, limited high-speed internet access, and the necessary hardware requirements. However, XR technologies are expected to become more prevalent in the near future as they become more affordable and accessible.#### Extended Reality (XR) statistics**$1.1 trillion** – the predicted global XR market by 2030Source: **75% of people** believe children are at significant risk of sexual abuse when using VR technologySource: **Four in 10** parents (41%) say they don’t know much, or anything, about the metaverse. Over half of children (53%) say the same.Source: ## The response: addressing the threatKey measures that can be taken by taken by a range of actors to prevent harm to children as access to XR technologies include:### Education and awareness- Equip young people and parents with information about the potential hazards and ways to avoid them, including through school education.### Technology- Prevent children from accessing inappropriate content, via user authentication, age restrictions, age assurance mechanisms and parental controls- Provide advice and education for children and their caregivers about managing risks- Allow users to block or otherwise restrict interactions with other users- Ensure content moderation systems are in place and work across platforms.- Adopt Safety by Design approaches with children in mind and address different types of risk to children.### Legislation- Ensure XR risks are covered in existing or new legislation and polic ~~.~~ y### Data and research- Investment in research and development is urgently required to support criminal investigation and prosecutions.### Involvement of children and young people- Include children and young people in product development and testing to support Safety by Design## Resources]( Report summarising key themes and insights from a roundtable with members, focusing on potential harms in XR environments and current mitigations, including robust content moderation, age assurance, user authentication, Safety by Design and collective social responsibility.]( WeProtect Global Alliance Executive Director Iain Drennan reflects on how without coordinated action, virtual reality risks to children will only worsen.]( WeProtect Global Alliance intelligence briefing, developed by Professor Emma Barrett OBE from The University of Manchester, aims to provide an overview of the latest information and trends on eXtended Reality (XR) and its potential impact on child sexual exploitation and abuse online.]( Our Global Threat Assessment report aims to encourage evidence-based action, recommend solutions and measures based on the evidence, and highlight opportunities to prevent abuse before it happens.## What our members are doingBelow are just some of the ways our members are working to protect children and young people from potential Extended Reality threats.]( The research included interviews and focus groups with experts in emerging technologies, a literature review, primary data collection through visits to virtual reality platforms and additional desk-based research.Based on the findings, and with support from Limina Immersive, the NSPCC has developed recommendations for government and industry on how to ensure children can remain safe in the metaverse.]( The report considers both positive and negative effects that virtual environments could have on children; the drivers of and predictions for the growth of the metaverse; and the regulatory and policy challenges posed by the metaverse.

The question on our minds is: Will 2024 witness a more widespread transition to this format?### Immersive ExperiencesAs VR technology continues to advance, the line between the virtual and the real is becoming increasingly blurred. Future VR isn’t just about visuals; it aims to encompass all of our senses. This means that upcoming VR platforms are not only focusing on improving visual fidelity but are also diving into areas like haptic feedback, 3D audio, and even scent emulation. Such hyper-realistic simulations will do more than just entertain; they’ll challenge our very perceptions of reality. By engaging multiple senses, they can evoke stronger emotions, create more memorable experiences, and even be used in therapeutic settings. As we look ahead, the potential for VR to create entirely immersive worlds is both exciting and limitless.!### Integration with ARThe convergence of Augmented Reality (AR) and VR is shaping up to be one of the most significant technological junctions in recent times. While VR offers a complete immersion in a digital world, AR overlays virtual elements onto our physical surroundings. The blending of these two realms promises a seamless continuum where users can transition smoothly between fully immersive and augmented experiences. This integration has the potential to revolutionise industries. For instance, in the realm of design and architecture, professionals could switch between altering a virtual model in VR and visualising those changes in a real-world context through AR. Similarly, in the entertainment sector, gamers could transition between playing in a fully immersive world and having game elements interact with their physical surroundings. The intertwining of AR and VR not only opens up new avenues for user experiences but also sets the stage for the development of hardware and software that cater to this hybrid reality.### AI Integrations with VRArtificial Intelligence (AI) and VR together promise a dynamic synergy.

This milestone year in the evolution of augmented and virtual reality technology has been marked by significant product launches, technological advancements, and industry shifts.While we won’t be able to tell you which VR headset to buy in 2023 (that is always down to a matter of personal preference), in this post we’ll delve into these developments, specifically spotlighting some of the headlining headsets that have helped to redefine the shape of the AR and VR market, and that have set us up for what will be a breakthrough year for XR in 2024. And who knows, maybe reading this analysis will provide you with several reasons to get a VR headset, if you don’t already own one.## Headset Launches2023 was an amazing year for hardware enthusiasts, with dozens of exciting headset releases and announcements. We’ll dive into some of our top picks of the year.![]( HTC VIVE XR EliteThe VIVE XR Elite was introduced by HTC at CES 2023 at the beginning of the year. The device was really one of the first mainstream consumer XR brands to mark the shift towards what the industry is currently referring to as “mixed reality.” Priced at $1,099, the headset stands out for its lightweight and compact design, making it one of the most comfortable VR headsets available.It features a screen resolution of 2K pixels per eye (4K combined), a 110-degree field of view, and a 90Hz refresh rate, offering users a finely tuned viewing experience. Additionally, the VIVE XR Elite boasts 128GB of memory and 12GB of RAM.Going first is never easy, especially when an entire industry is watching and waiting to see what bar you are setting in order to fine tune their own offerings. However, despite the VIVE XR Elite coming out almost a year ago now, the headset is still one of the best mixed reality devices you can get at the moment, and an extremely solid contender within the standalone headset market. Plus, combining the device with VIVE’s enormous ecosystem of other hardware/software offerings and PC VR compatibility, it’s likely this device will still be the headset of choice for many this time next year.![]( **Apple Vision Pro**A solid picture of what Apple\\\\\\'s foray into the AR/VR domain is going to look like finally materialized this year, with the company announcing the Vision Pro, a spatial computing device set to ship in early 2024. Priced at $3,499, the headset features dual 4K displays, gesture tracking, and both an M2 chip and the new R1 chip that has been specifically designed for real-time processing of the real world. The Vision Pro packs an ultra-high-resolution display system with 23 million pixels across two displays (for reference, a 4K TV features more than 8 million pixels).As well as an entirely new device from Apple, the company has also built its new VisionOS, the brand new operating system on which the Vision Pro will run. Through a combination of some incredible hardware and a new powerful operating system, the Vision Pro has been designed to give users as lag-free an experience as possible, which in turn should help to tackle one of VR’s most common problems – motion sickness.Furthermore, in addition to the physical HMD and a new OS, the launch of the Vision Pro demonstrates Apple’s commitment to AR technology. The company rarely introduces a product without a viable use case, and its introduction of a new form factor highlights Apple’s bullish position on spatial computing as a new tool through which it can bring more value to users.The device is  to become available in March 2024, however this is yet to be confirmed by Apple themselves. Some industry commentators are  that the Vision Pro is the best headset that they have ever tried. Regardless of your opinion on Apple, it is hard to argue that the company’s entry into the XR market this year was probably the single most anticipated move by any tech company in the AR/VR space ever, and expectations are certainly running high for the upcoming headset.![]( **Meta Quest 3**Released in September at a price of $499.99, the Meta Quest 3 set a new standard in the XR headset market. Building on the success of the Quest 2, Meta’s Quest 3 device introduced a slimmer and lighter design, enhancing comfort for extended use. A significant 30% increase in visual resolution and a 40% louder audio range compared to its predecessor also marked major improvements.The Quest 3 was also the first device to feature Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 Snapdragon platform (more on this in a bit), coupled with 8GB of RAM, doubling the graphical power of the Quest 3 when compared with the Quest 2.Marketed as a “mixed reality\" device (for clarification on the terms, see our last blog post on the subject), the Quest 3’s AR passthrough capabilities on a VR headset have allowed creators and game developers to come up with entirely new ways in which users can interact with their surroundings. These advancements not only improve the user experience but also push the boundaries of what\\\\\\'s possible in virtual and mixed reality environments.![]( **Bigscreen Beyond**Also released in September 2023, Bigscreen Beyond is a groundbreaking VR headset, noted for being the world’s smallest, weighing just 127 grams, yet still packing a punch. Priced at $999, it features MicroOLED displays and advanced pancake optics, offering a high resolution of 5120 x 2560 pixels and up to 90 Hz refresh rates. Bigscreen Beyond\\\\\\'s slim profile is designed for comfort and fully supports VR games on Steam with compatibility to SteamVR tracking.The headset looks like something straight out of a futuristic sci-fi movie, and could well be paving the way for a future of small, slimline VR headset form factors. If this is how headsets look in 5-10 years time, we wouldn’t be disappointed. But the beauty is, you don’t have to wait half a decade to look like you’re already in Ready Player One - you can order your own Bigscreen Beyond device today!![]( **Lynx R1**The Lynx R1 only came out last month, but there have been enough demos of the headset for the market to know that Lynx is a serious player when it comes to functional XR hardware. The R1 is a groundbreaking mixed reality headset that stands out for its affordability and innovation. Priced at $849 for the standard edition, it offers a blend of VR and AR with a unique \"True Mixed Reality\" experience.The device prioritizes user experience, data sovereignty, and privacy, requiring no Facebook account or cloud connection, and allows for complete offline operation. Featuring the Snapdragon XR2 Gen 1 processor and \"4-fold catadioptric\" lenses, the R1 ensures a slimmer design and balanced weight distribution, making it a significant addition to 2023’s lineup of new XR headsets.The beautiful thing about the Lynx R1 is that it is truly helping to change people’s lives—for example, by helping those who are visually impaired to see more of the world—which alone is reason enough to include it in this blog post. You can  on stage with Chris McNally at AWE USA earlier this year highlighting the R1’s suitability as an assistive technology device.![]( **Varjo XR-4 Series**Only very recently announced (last week!) was Varjo’s latest lineup of headsets, the XR-4 series, which includes the XR-4, XR-4 Focal Edition and XR-4 Secure Edition. This most recent announcement from the company, whose headsets are known for their high-fidelity visuals and industrial-grade build, represents a significant leap in XR technology.Varjo\\\\\\'s headsets are a go-to choice for professionals in various fields such as design, engineering, and simulation training. The Varjo XR-4 Series seems like it will be setting a very high bar in the professional XR headset market, thanks to unparalleled visual fidelity and robust features. The company’s technology always seems to exemplify the power and potential of XR for transforming professional workflows, training, and research. However, this means that the devices come with quite a hefty price tag.The XR-4 series starts at $3,990, so definitely not the sort of device that users buying on a budget would be considering. However, with specs that  device (which also has its own hefty price tag), it will still have an appeal to professional consumers. Although initial availability for the XR-4 series will be reserved for enterprise purchases only, Varjo is offering a waitlist for those consumers that are looking for the absolute best level of visual fidelity in their XR experiences.![]( What Lies AheadThis review is by no means an exhaustive list, and there have been many other amazing headset launches and announcements that have taken place this year. However, there simply isn’t space to cover every single one of them in this post. But that in itself should be a very positive indicator for the XR industry, in that there is now so much choice when it comes to VR/MR devices, it signals that the industry is continuing to mature. Growth in demand from both consumers and the enterprise is helping to drive innovation across the sector, which can only be a good thing for the future of augmented, virtual and mixed reality technologies.Part two of this series will take a look at some of the other XR technologies that have been announced this year that have made a huge impact on the progress of the industry as a whole. While it is unknown exactly what new devices and headsets will arrive in 2024, one thing is for sure - you’ll be able to experience the latest in this cutting edge XR technology and get hands on with the latest VR and AR devices at AWE’s events next year.Super Early Bird tickets for AWE USA in Long Beach, California are still on sale for just $695, so make sure you’re a part of what will be the most exciting XR event of 2024.Plus, if you’re interested in participating in other ways, whether speaking, exhibiting, sponsoring, or joining AWE’s enterprise program, there are plenty of ways to  in next year’s events.Share This Article### Recent Post11 Sep 2025AWE Talks: Elevating Storytelling to StorylivingAWE USA 2025byMike Boland]( Sep 2025AWE Talks: Unlocking AI By Linking it to the Real WorldAWE USA 2025byMike Boland]( Sep 2025AWE Talks: A Bushel of Bushnell\\\\\\'sAWE USA 2025byMike Boland]( Sep 2025AWE Talks: Elevating Storytelling to StorylivingAWE USA 2025byMike Boland]( Sep 2025AWE Talks: Unlocking AI By Linking it to the Real WorldAWE USA 2025byMike Boland]( Sep 2025AWE Talks: A Bushel of Bushnell\\\\\\'sAWE USA 2025byMike Boland]( Sep 2025AWE Talks: Elevating Storytelling to StorylivingAWE USA 2025byMike Boland]( Sep 2025AWE Talks: Unlocking AI By Linking it to the Real WorldAWE USA 2025byMike Boland]( 1- 2- 3### Cookie settingsWe use cookies to provide you with the best possible experience.

It transforms how consumers entertain, shop, socialize, and express art. It is pivotal across industries and is increasingly accessible to consumers via smartphone AR apps. However, challenges with current smartphone AR experiences, including limited applications and content, low immersion, physical discomfort, and social acceptance issues, hinder consumer adoption. Furthermore, consumer-friendly AR/MR devices remain scarce. Nonetheless, consumers consistently express interest in AR experiences, anticipating lightweight and portable AR/MR devices to become essential companions to smartphones.Extended reality (XR) refers to a range of technologies, including augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and mixed reality (MR), that combine physical and digital environments to create . Headsets, glasses as well as smartphones are the common devices used to bring these technologies to life.## Key findings#### Consumer AR – key insights with Jasmeet SethiEricsson ConsumerLab conducted extensive research across 10 global markets with current and prospective extended reality (XR) users, revealing four pivotal insights shaping consumer expectations and needs for augmented reality (AR) experiences over the next five years. Tune in and learn about the key insights and implications with Jasmeet Sethi, head of Ericsson ConsumerLab.Watch the video.![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns=\\\\\\' viewBox=\\\\\\'0 0 16 9\\\\\\'%3E%3C/svg%3E)]( 1. Consumers combining smartphones and AR devices will double in the next five yearsDespite low satisfaction with current smartphone AR experiences, those that combine smartphone and VR/AR/MR headsets/glasses tend to be happier. Over the next five years, the share of such combined use is projected to double. Furthermore, consumers expect lightweight and portable AR/MR devices becoming essential companions to smartphones.]( 2. Consumers are hungry for on-the-go AR devices and willing to pay 20 percent more for the portabilityToday, VR/AR/MR headsets/glasses are largely limited to home use, serving as shared household devices. However, three-quarters of consumers anticipate the availability of portable AR devices, likely in glasses form, for outside-of-home and on-the-go use in the next five years, expressing a willingness to pay a premium for such devices.]( 3. As AR technology advances in adapting to geospatial surroundings, the range of experiences will become more diverse and demanding on 5GCurrent consumer AR experiences center on information, navigation, and social AR filters. As geospatial AR technology progresses, the use case landscape will expand to include more diverse applications featuring precise location tracking and enhanced environmental awareness. Examples of such applications are AR sports viewing and concerts, public digital arts, and augmented tourist displays. This expansion will demand 5G networks to deliver consistent, real-time experiences.]( 4. Bystander privacy still looms large, hindering device adoptionBystander privacy, referring to consumers feeling exposed to others scanning them with AR devices, remains a critical concern among consumers, with 60 percent expressing apprehension globally. This worry significantly reduces the share of users intending to adopt AR devices by 18 percentage points.#### Augmented tomorrow: AR experiences beyond smartphones and AR filtersExploring consumer expectations and needs in an evolving XR landscape.]( 1. Consumers combining smartphones and AR devices will double in the next five yearsThe smartphone has become inseparable from consumers\\\\\\' lives, serving as an extension of their bodies. Its ubiquity makes it challenging for users to envision a replacement. While smartphones serve as the primary entry point for AR experiences, and consumer interest in AR experiences has been increasing steadily among 5G users in the past three years, overall satisfaction remains low, at only 42 percent, due to numerous limitations and challenges with current smartphone AR experiences, including limited applications, irrelevant content, small screens, arm fatigue, and low immersion.However, consumers who use both smartphone AR apps and VR/AR/MR headsets/glasses tend to be more satisfied with smartphone AR experiences, with almost half reporting content, about 10 percentage points higher than those who don’t use both. Today, about 1 out of 10 users utilize both smartphone AR and VR/AR/MR headsets/glasses, and this number is expected to double in the next five years. This highlights the undeniable importance of headsets/glasses in delivering comprehensive experiences alongside smartphones, despite ongoing challenges in achieving full consumer-friendliness.#### User groups - today versus in 5 years!Consumers expect AR/MR devices, likely in glasses form, to become companions to smartphones, with 62 percent expressing willingness to connect these devices to smartphones for elevated experiences, provided these devices will evolve and become compact, lightweight, and offer extended battery life.## 2. Consumers are hungry for on-the-go AR devices and willing to pay 20 percent more for the portabilityToday, VR/AR/MR headsets/glasses are predominantly used within homes and perceived as shared devices, with 64 percent of users reporting sharing their devices with household members. This highlights the current domestic and communal nature of such devices.However, as anticipation grows for the evolution and enhancement of AR/MR devices over the next five years, three-quarters of consumers express a desire to extend their usage beyond home settings. This shift mirrors the historical trajectory of the telephone, which transformed from a stationary household device to a mobile, personal essential. As AR/MR devices become more portable, advanced, sleek, affordable and socially acceptable, they are poised to transition into personal, everyday accessories akin to smartphones.In fact, the desire for increased portability is so pronounced that consumers are willing to pay an average of 20 percent premium for devices usable outside of home. Locations that can command relatively higher price premiums compared to home are arenas or concert venues, common shopping areas/centers and social establishments such as cafes and restaurants.#### Percentage points difference in price\\\\xa0willing to payThree quarters of consumers expect to be able to use AR/MR headsets on-the-go in the next five years.Price premium (relative to other locations)Select allAt home: -8%On a plane: 18%While commuting: 21%At the workplace: 25%In cafes or restaurants: 27%In shopping areas/stores: 28%In arenas/concert venues: 33%No data to display.Desired locations to use AR/MR headsets in the next five years\"I think (bringing XR devices outside-of-home) is more important because at home there\\\\\\'s only so much that you can do. It\\\\\\'d be great if I could bring it outside. For example, bringing it to vacations, to other countries.\"- XR user, Japan## 3. As AR technology advances in adapting to geospatial surroundings, the range of experiences will become more diverse and demanding on 5GAs the industry advances, we foresee a three-stage transition for consumer AR experiences over the next five years.Initially, basic AR experiences, such as social, and informational applications, will become widely available to consumers. This stage has already commenced and will continue to evolve in the coming one to two years. This is followed by the second stage during which more location-based and geospatially aware experiences will become widely accessible to consumers thanks to the expected advancement in geospatial AR technology. Finally, more advanced, and native experiences will begin to emerge and gradually become widely available to consumers. For instance, consumers will be able to enjoy mixed reality cinematic experiences anywhere and have 3D digital exercise companions during workouts.As AR experiences evolve, the devices available to consumers will also undergo a transformation. This evolution will commence with smartphones dominating the initial stage, followed by lightweight, portable AR/MR devices acting as companions to smartphones, enabling outside-the-home and on-the-go use. Eventually, standalone AR/MR devices will emerge to facilitate native and more advanced experiences.!## 4. Bystander privacy still looms large, hindering device adoptionWhile early adopters have shown interest in XR, the adoption among the general population still lags. This slow uptake is attributed to a variety of factors, including technological challenges, device design, social acceptance, alongside privacy concerns.Social acceptance plays a crucial role in influencing consumer adoption. Over 60 percent express reluctance to use AR/MR devices publicly unless they are visually appealing. Additionally, more than half are apprehensive about potential health and safety risks. Another significant aspect of social acceptance is bystander privacy, meaning consumers are exposed to others taking pictures or videos with AR/MR devices. While fewer consumers, around 2 out of 10, show concern about being captured by others using AR/MR devices as bystanders, many more, around 6 out of 10, show concern if these pictures and videos are shared with others, with or without their consent.The amassed impact of bystander privacy issues influences consumers\\\\\\' willingness to adopt AR/MR devices. This becomes evident when examining the share of consumers intending to purchase an AR/MR device. Notably, for those who are concerned about bystander privacy, the intention to adopt is 18 percentage points lower than for those who are not concerned.#### Bystander privacy concern - impact on AR device adoptionUsers who are not concernedUsers who are concernedSelect allz-empty-common-0No data to display.Share of users who will buy an AR/MR device during the first year\"Previous headsets made people look stupid and people may look at you weirdly if you wear AR glasses.\"- XR user, the US## Implications on the 5G network![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns=\\\\\\' viewBox=\\\\\\'0 0 16 9\\\\\\'%3E%3C/svg%3E)The evolution of the AR market will require efforts from a range of ecosystem players to drive both technological development and consumer adoption. Collaboration within the ecosystem will be essential to propel AR technology to its full potential, focusing on diverse areas such as improving connectivity, ensuring seamless transitions between devices, improving application and content relevance, addressing privacy concerns, and shaping the societal acceptance of AR/MR devices.As portable AR/MR devices, likely in glasses form, gain popularity and social acceptance for everyday use, their reliability and utility in various contexts will increasingly hinge on network and cellular connectivity. Network infrastructure must be optimized for widespread usage outside of home and on the go. Wide area connectivity or 5G hotspots will be vital in high-traffic locations such as airports, train/subway stations, arenas/concert venues, stores or shopping areas, social establishments such as cafes and restaurants, or while commuting.On the other hand, increased AR adoption and the use of smartphone-connected portable AR/MR devices will also present new revenue opportunities for communications service providers (CSPs) in both consumer and developer markets. For example, CSPs can offer higher tethering allowances for AR/MR devices and premium plans with quality of service (QoS) differentiation in high-traffic locations for consumers. Simultaneously, they can provide developers with network APIs optimized for XR traffic demands.#### What will AR development look like in the near future?![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns=\\\\\\' viewBox=\\\\\\'0 0 16 9\\\\\\'%3E%3C/svg%3E)## Methodology#### Qualitative research:22 in-depth interviews were conducted between April and June 2023 with 12 current AR/VR users, 7 industry experts and 3 XR startup companies: TagSpace, forwARdgame and EyecandyLab.

This includes:- Virtual Reality (VR), which usually involves the user wearing a headset that displays a simulation of the real world- Augmented Reality (AR), which enhances the real-world environment by overlaying digital elements- Mixed Reality (MR), which integrates elements of VR and AR, to create a blended experience where the virtual and physical interact seamlessly.Although XR technologies have existed for decades, there has been a surge in interest, investment and availability in recent years, especially in workplaces and consumer leisure sectors. The global market for XR is forecasted to surpass $1.1 trillion by 2030.Augmented reality content for mobile phones is already widely available for consumers to use in app stores like Google Play and the Apple App store, Bespoke platforms are also being developed in industrial and workplace settings. Virtual reality content is available in various forms including gaming and education platforms and often includes use of a headset.The emergence of Extended Reality (XR) technologies - YouTubeWeProtect Global Alliance210 subscribersWeProtect Global AllianceSearchWatch laterShareCopy linkInfoShoppingTap to unmuteIf playback doesn\\'t begin shortly, try restarting your device.Full screen is unavailable.

Unfortunately, as with any emerging technology there is a risk that offenders may use these new environments to exploit children.The Alliance’s  highlighted the risks posed to child safety, including opportunities for offenders to access victims, distribute child sexual abuse material, simulate abuse of virtual children, and use haptics to mimic real-world sensations like movement and force. Predators can also exploit ‘off-platforming’, where they move communication from XR environments to other platforms to groom children.In May 2024, we facilitated a roundtable discussion with leading experts to discuss key risks, challenges and opportunities to make the metaverse and technologies safer. A summary paper, , outlines the key issues discussed and opportunities for action.Virtual reality users are usually isolated by the use of headsets, which can further exacerbate risks to children.> We know perpetrators will find any crack in platforms they can penetrate. There’s a huge amount of work to be done, but also a lot of “ knowledge we already have.>> Participant in WeProtect Global Alliance roundtable discussion on XR### Who is likely to be impacted?Children form a significant portion of the XR (Extended Reality) user base, with gaming becoming an integral part of their daily lives.  of children aged 7-10 revealed that they feel safest on private messaging apps and gaming platforms, even though these are often areas where online abuse occurs.Currently, many children worldwide cannot access these emerging technologies due to high costs, limited high-speed internet access, and the necessary hardware requirements. However, XR technologies are expected to become more prevalent in the near future as they become more affordable and accessible.#### Extended Reality (XR) statistics**$1.1 trillion** – the predicted global XR market by 2030Source: **75% of people** believe children are at significant risk of sexual abuse when using VR technologySource: **Four in 10** parents (41%) say they don’t know much, or anything, about the metaverse. Over half of children (53%) say the same.Source: ## The response: addressing the threatKey measures that can be taken by taken by a range of actors to prevent harm to children as access to XR technologies include:### Education and awareness- Equip young people and parents with information about the potential hazards and ways to avoid them, including through school education.### Technology- Prevent children from accessing inappropriate content, via user authentication, age restrictions, age assurance mechanisms and parental controls- Provide advice and education for children and their caregivers about managing risks- Allow users to block or otherwise restrict interactions with other users- Ensure content moderation systems are in place and work across platforms.- Adopt Safety by Design approaches with children in mind and address different types of risk to children.### Legislation- Ensure XR risks are covered in existing or new legislation and polic ~~.~~ y### Data and research- Investment in research and development is urgently required to support criminal investigation and prosecutions.### Involvement of children and young people- Include children and young people in product development and testing to support Safety by Design## Resources]( Report summarising key themes and insights from a roundtable with members, focusing on potential harms in XR environments and current mitigations, including robust content moderation, age assurance, user authentication, Safety by Design and collective social responsibility.]( WeProtect Global Alliance Executive Director Iain Drennan reflects on how without coordinated action, virtual reality risks to children will only worsen.]( WeProtect Global Alliance intelligence briefing, developed by Professor Emma Barrett OBE from The University of Manchester, aims to provide an overview of the latest information and trends on eXtended Reality (XR) and its potential impact on child sexual exploitation and abuse online.]( Our Global Threat Assessment report aims to encourage evidence-based action, recommend solutions and measures based on the evidence, and highlight opportunities to prevent abuse before it happens.## What our members are doingBelow are just some of the ways our members are working to protect children and young people from potential Extended Reality threats.]( The research included interviews and focus groups with experts in emerging technologies, a literature review, primary data collection through visits to virtual reality platforms and additional desk-based research.Based on the findings, and with support from Limina Immersive, the NSPCC has developed recommendations for government and industry on how to ensure children can remain safe in the metaverse.]( The report considers both positive and negative effects that virtual environments could have on children; the drivers of and predictions for the growth of the metaverse; and the regulatory and policy challenges posed by the metaverse.

However, at , our attention was predominantly captured by VR’s increasing role in emulating real-world scenarios, such as in professional contexts or product visualisations. The corporate world is slowly waking up to the advantages VR can offer, particularly regarding training simulations.The software aspect of VR has also seen remarkable advancements. Companies like Unity and Unreal have provided VR developers with increasingly sophisticated tools, simplifying the creation process. The rise of OpenXR is also helpful, enabling software compatibility across a variety of headsets.### Predictions for the Near FutureThe hardware evolution isn’t slowing down. In the upcoming year, we’re anticipating several  releases, with  being particularly anticipated. The trajectory is clear: increasingly powerful capabilities will be packaged in sleeker, lighter designs. At Mersus, our focus has been on pioneering apps that favour hand tracking over traditional controllers, especially for mobile headsets. The market still has a limited number of entities producing VR training modules for untethered headsets utilising hand tracking. The question on our minds is: Will 2024 witness a more widespread transition to this format?### Immersive ExperiencesAs VR technology continues to advance, the line between the virtual and the real is becoming increasingly blurred. Future VR isn’t just about visuals; it aims to encompass all of our senses. This means that upcoming VR platforms are not only focusing on improving visual fidelity but are also diving into areas like haptic feedback, 3D audio, and even scent emulation. Such hyper-realistic simulations will do more than just entertain; they’ll challenge our very perceptions of reality. By engaging multiple senses, they can evoke stronger emotions, create more memorable experiences, and even be used in therapeutic settings. As we look ahead, the potential for VR to create entirely immersive worlds is both exciting and limitless.!### Integration with ARThe convergence of Augmented Reality (AR) and VR is shaping up to be one of the most significant technological junctions in recent times. While VR offers a complete immersion in a digital world, AR overlays virtual elements onto our physical surroundings. The blending of these two realms promises a seamless continuum where users can transition smoothly between fully immersive and augmented experiences. This integration has the potential to revolutionise industries. For instance, in the realm of design and architecture, professionals could switch between altering a virtual model in VR and visualising those changes in a real-world context through AR. Similarly, in the entertainment sector, gamers could transition between playing in a fully immersive world and having game elements interact with their physical surroundings. The intertwining of AR and VR not only opens up new avenues for user experiences but also sets the stage for the development of hardware and software that cater to this hybrid reality.### AI Integrations with VRArtificial Intelligence (AI) and VR together promise a dynamic synergy. One of the most promising uses of AI in VR is the customisation of user experiences through smart algorithms.\\\\xa0 This is most relevant to Mersus Technologies in the power AI can bring to tailoring a trainee on the  platform’s learning journey.Moreover, AI’s capability to procedurally generate VR environments can lead to expansive, intricately detailed landscapes. Such environments could be constantly evolving, offering unpredictability and novelty to users. Additionally, integrating AI can infuse Non-Playable Characters (NPCs) with a semblance of autonomy, making them more nuanced and engaging for users.The landscape of Virtual Reality is continuously evolving, presenting opportunities that refine our interaction with digital environments. As we stand at the threshold of further advancements in VR, it’s clear that the industry is charting a course towards even more immersive and nuanced experiences. Reflecting on the strides and innovations of recent years offers perspective on this progression. The future of VR promises enhanced realism and immersion, bridging the divide between the tangible and the virtual. As we move forward, the unfolding developments in Virtual Reality are sure to be both intriguing and impactful.### Consult, Design, Develop, Deploy & Analyse                   ## Related Posts]( “Meet Mersus” – Mersus’ inaugural official video biography]( Mar 2024]( the Synergy of AI and VR – AI and VR Integration]( Jul 2023]( for Training in Ireland (Demo)]( Feb 2019]( Evolution of Virtual Reality: Past, Present, and Future]( Mar 2025]( Training and Remote Work: A Game-Changer for Global Teams]( Mar 2025]( Stories of Virtual Reality Training]( Feb 2025]( Reality in Healthcare: Enhancing Patient Care]( Mar 2025]( Tracking: Elevating VR Training to the Next Level]( Feb 2025]( Learning: Why It Works]( Apr 2025]( Reality Glove – Interview with Dr Brendan O’Flynn (Demo)]( Jan 2018]( Reality The Game Changer for High-Risk Industries]( Mar 2025\\'}]\\n[{\\'title\\': \\'The Top 5 VR Innovations Unveiled at CES 2023 - XpertVR 2025\\', \\'url\\': \\'https://xpertvr.ca/the-top-5-vr-innovations-unveiled-at-ces-2023/\\', \\'markdown\\': \"!![]( White decorative]( to content]( #1 - Magic LeapFor years, Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) have been on the brink of revolutionizing technology as we know it.

This milestone year in the evolution of augmented and virtual reality technology has been marked by significant product launches, technological advancements, and industry shifts.While we won’t be able to tell you which VR headset to buy in 2023 (that is always down to a matter of personal preference), in this post we’ll delve into these developments, specifically spotlighting some of the headlining headsets that have helped to redefine the shape of the AR and VR market, and that have set us up for what will be a breakthrough year for XR in 2024. And who knows, maybe reading this analysis will provide you with several reasons to get a VR headset, if you don’t already own one.## Headset Launches2023 was an amazing year for hardware enthusiasts, with dozens of exciting headset releases and announcements. We’ll dive into some of our top picks of the year.![]( HTC VIVE XR EliteThe VIVE XR Elite was introduced by HTC at CES 2023 at the beginning of the year. The device was really one of the first mainstream consumer XR brands to mark the shift towards what the industry is currently referring to as “mixed reality.” Priced at $1,099, the headset stands out for its lightweight and compact design, making it one of the most comfortable VR headsets available.It features a screen resolution of 2K pixels per eye (4K combined), a 110-degree field of view, and a 90Hz refresh rate, offering users a finely tuned viewing experience. Additionally, the VIVE XR Elite boasts 128GB of memory and 12GB of RAM.Going first is never easy, especially when an entire industry is watching and waiting to see what bar you are setting in order to fine tune their own offerings. However, despite the VIVE XR Elite coming out almost a year ago now, the headset is still one of the best mixed reality devices you can get at the moment, and an extremely solid contender within the standalone headset market. Plus, combining the device with VIVE’s enormous ecosystem of other hardware/software offerings and PC VR compatibility, it’s likely this device will still be the headset of choice for many this time next year.![]( **Apple Vision Pro**A solid picture of what Apple\\\\\\'s foray into the AR/VR domain is going to look like finally materialized this year, with the company announcing the Vision Pro, a spatial computing device set to ship in early 2024. Priced at $3,499, the headset features dual 4K displays, gesture tracking, and both an M2 chip and the new R1 chip that has been specifically designed for real-time processing of the real world. The Vision Pro packs an ultra-high-resolution display system with 23 million pixels across two displays (for reference, a 4K TV features more than 8 million pixels).As well as an entirely new device from Apple, the company has also built its new VisionOS, the brand new operating system on which the Vision Pro will run. Through a combination of some incredible hardware and a new powerful operating system, the Vision Pro has been designed to give users as lag-free an experience as possible, which in turn should help to tackle one of VR’s most common problems – motion sickness.Furthermore, in addition to the physical HMD and a new OS, the launch of the Vision Pro demonstrates Apple’s commitment to AR technology. The company rarely introduces a product without a viable use case, and its introduction of a new form factor highlights Apple’s bullish position on spatial computing as a new tool through which it can bring more value to users.The device is  to become available in March 2024, however this is yet to be confirmed by Apple themselves. Some industry commentators are  that the Vision Pro is the best headset that they have ever tried. Regardless of your opinion on Apple, it is hard to argue that the company’s entry into the XR market this year was probably the single most anticipated move by any tech company in the AR/VR space ever, and expectations are certainly running high for the upcoming headset.![]( **Meta Quest 3**Released in September at a price of $499.99, the Meta Quest 3 set a new standard in the XR headset market. Building on the success of the Quest 2, Meta’s Quest 3 device introduced a slimmer and lighter design, enhancing comfort for extended use. A significant 30% increase in visual resolution and a 40% louder audio range compared to its predecessor also marked major improvements.The Quest 3 was also the first device to feature Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 Snapdragon platform (more on this in a bit), coupled with 8GB of RAM, doubling the graphical power of the Quest 3 when compared with the Quest 2.Marketed as a “mixed reality\" device (for clarification on the terms, see our last blog post on the subject), the Quest 3’s AR passthrough capabilities on a VR headset have allowed creators and game developers to come up with entirely new ways in which users can interact with their surroundings. These advancements not only improve the user experience but also push the boundaries of what\\\\\\'s possible in virtual and mixed reality environments.![]( **Bigscreen Beyond**Also released in September 2023, Bigscreen Beyond is a groundbreaking VR headset, noted for being the world’s smallest, weighing just 127 grams, yet still packing a punch. Priced at $999, it features MicroOLED displays and advanced pancake optics, offering a high resolution of 5120 x 2560 pixels and up to 90 Hz refresh rates. Bigscreen Beyond\\\\\\'s slim profile is designed for comfort and fully supports VR games on Steam with compatibility to SteamVR tracking.The headset looks like something straight out of a futuristic sci-fi movie, and could well be paving the way for a future of small, slimline VR headset form factors. If this is how headsets look in 5-10 years time, we wouldn’t be disappointed. But the beauty is, you don’t have to wait half a decade to look like you’re already in Ready Player One - you can order your own Bigscreen Beyond device today!![]( **Lynx R1**The Lynx R1 only came out last month, but there have been enough demos of the headset for the market to know that Lynx is a serious player when it comes to functional XR hardware. The R1 is a groundbreaking mixed reality headset that stands out for its affordability and innovation. Priced at $849 for the standard edition, it offers a blend of VR and AR with a unique \"True Mixed Reality\" experience.The device prioritizes user experience, data sovereignty, and privacy, requiring no Facebook account or cloud connection, and allows for complete offline operation. Featuring the Snapdragon XR2 Gen 1 processor and \"4-fold catadioptric\" lenses, the R1 ensures a slimmer design and balanced weight distribution, making it a significant addition to 2023’s lineup of new XR headsets.The beautiful thing about the Lynx R1 is that it is truly helping to change people’s lives—for example, by helping those who are visually impaired to see more of the world—which alone is reason enough to include it in this blog post. You can  on stage with Chris McNally at AWE USA earlier this year highlighting the R1’s suitability as an assistive technology device.![]( **Varjo XR-4 Series**Only very recently announced (last week!) was Varjo’s latest lineup of headsets, the XR-4 series, which includes the XR-4, XR-4 Focal Edition and XR-4 Secure Edition. This most recent announcement from the company, whose headsets are known for their high-fidelity visuals and industrial-grade build, represents a significant leap in XR technology.Varjo\\\\\\'s headsets are a go-to choice for professionals in various fields such as design, engineering, and simulation training. The Varjo XR-4 Series seems like it will be setting a very high bar in the professional XR headset market, thanks to unparalleled visual fidelity and robust features. The company’s technology always seems to exemplify the power and potential of XR for transforming professional workflows, training, and research. However, this means that the devices come with quite a hefty price tag.The XR-4 series starts at $3,990, so definitely not the sort of device that users buying on a budget would be considering. However, with specs that  device (which also has its own hefty price tag), it will still have an appeal to professional consumers. Although initial availability for the XR-4 series will be reserved for enterprise purchases only, Varjo is offering a waitlist for those consumers that are looking for the absolute best level of visual fidelity in their XR experiences.![]( What Lies AheadThis review is by no means an exhaustive list, and there have been many other amazing headset launches and announcements that have taken place this year. However, there simply isn’t space to cover every single one of them in this post. But that in itself should be a very positive indicator for the XR industry, in that there is now so much choice when it comes to VR/MR devices, it signals that the industry is continuing to mature. Growth in demand from both consumers and the enterprise is helping to drive innovation across the sector, which can only be a good thing for the future of augmented, virtual and mixed reality technologies.Part two of this series will take a look at some of the other XR technologies that have been announced this year that have made a huge impact on the progress of the industry as a whole. While it is unknown exactly what new devices and headsets will arrive in 2024, one thing is for sure - you’ll be able to experience the latest in this cutting edge XR technology and get hands on with the latest VR and AR devices at AWE’s events next year.Super Early Bird tickets for AWE USA in Long Beach, California are still on sale for just $695, so make sure you’re a part of what will be the most exciting XR event of 2024.Plus, if you’re interested in participating in other ways, whether speaking, exhibiting, sponsoring, or joining AWE’s enterprise program, there are plenty of ways to  in next year’s events.Share This Article### Recent Post11 Sep 2025AWE Talks: Elevating Storytelling to StorylivingAWE USA 2025byMike Boland]( Sep 2025AWE Talks: Unlocking AI By Linking it to the Real WorldAWE USA 2025byMike Boland]( Sep 2025AWE Talks: A Bushel of Bushnell\\\\\\'sAWE USA 2025byMike Boland]( Sep 2025AWE Talks: Elevating Storytelling to StorylivingAWE USA 2025byMike Boland]( Sep 2025AWE Talks: Unlocking AI By Linking it to the Real WorldAWE USA 2025byMike Boland]( Sep 2025AWE Talks: A Bushel of Bushnell\\\\\\'sAWE USA 2025byMike Boland]( Sep 2025AWE Talks: Elevating Storytelling to StorylivingAWE USA 2025byMike Boland]( Sep 2025AWE Talks: Unlocking AI By Linking it to the Real WorldAWE USA 2025byMike Boland]( 1- 2- 3### Cookie settingsWe use cookies to provide you with the best possible experience.

This shift mirrors the historical trajectory of the telephone, which transformed from a stationary household device to a mobile, personal essential. As AR/MR devices become more portable, advanced, sleek, affordable and socially acceptable, they are poised to transition into personal, everyday accessories akin to smartphones.In fact, the desire for increased portability is so pronounced that consumers are willing to pay an average of 20 percent premium for devices usable outside of home. Locations that can command relatively higher price premiums compared to home are arenas or concert venues, common shopping areas/centers and social establishments such as cafes and restaurants.#### Percentage points difference in price\\\\xa0willing to payThree quarters of consumers expect to be able to use AR/MR headsets on-the-go in the next five years.Price premium (relative to other locations)Select allAt home: -8%On a plane: 18%While commuting: 21%At the workplace: 25%In cafes or restaurants: 27%In shopping areas/stores: 28%In arenas/concert venues: 33%No data to display.Desired locations to use AR/MR headsets in the next five years\"I think (bringing XR devices outside-of-home) is more important because at home there\\\\\\'s only so much that you can do. It\\\\\\'d be great if I could bring it outside. For example, bringing it to vacations, to other countries.\"- XR user, Japan## 3. As AR technology advances in adapting to geospatial surroundings, the range of experiences will become more diverse and demanding on 5GAs the industry advances, we foresee a three-stage transition for consumer AR experiences over the next five years.Initially, basic AR experiences, such as social, and informational applications, will become widely available to consumers. This stage has already commenced and will continue to evolve in the coming one to two years. This is followed by the second stage during which more location-based and geospatially aware experiences will become widely accessible to consumers thanks to the expected advancement in geospatial AR technology. Finally, more advanced, and native experiences will begin to emerge and gradually become widely available to consumers. For instance, consumers will be able to enjoy mixed reality cinematic experiences anywhere and have 3D digital exercise companions during workouts.As AR experiences evolve, the devices available to consumers will also undergo a transformation. This evolution will commence with smartphones dominating the initial stage, followed by lightweight, portable AR/MR devices acting as companions to smartphones, enabling outside-the-home and on-the-go use. Eventually, standalone AR/MR devices will emerge to facilitate native and more advanced experiences.!## 4. Bystander privacy still looms large, hindering device adoptionWhile early adopters have shown interest in XR, the adoption among the general population still lags. This slow uptake is attributed to a variety of factors, including technological challenges, device design, social acceptance, alongside privacy concerns.Social acceptance plays a crucial role in influencing consumer adoption. Over 60 percent express reluctance to use AR/MR devices publicly unless they are visually appealing. Additionally, more than half are apprehensive about potential health and safety risks. Another significant aspect of social acceptance is bystander privacy, meaning consumers are exposed to others taking pictures or videos with AR/MR devices. While fewer consumers, around 2 out of 10, show concern about being captured by others using AR/MR devices as bystanders, many more, around 6 out of 10, show concern if these pictures and videos are shared with others, with or without their consent.The amassed impact of bystander privacy issues influences consumers\\\\\\' willingness to adopt AR/MR devices. This becomes evident when examining the share of consumers intending to purchase an AR/MR device. Notably, for those who are concerned about bystander privacy, the intention to adopt is 18 percentage points lower than for those who are not concerned.#### Bystander privacy concern - impact on AR device adoptionUsers who are not concernedUsers who are concernedSelect allz-empty-common-0No data to display.Share of users who will buy an AR/MR device during the first year\"Previous headsets made people look stupid and people may look at you weirdly if you wear AR glasses.\"- XR user, the US## Implications on the 5G network![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns=\\\\\\' viewBox=\\\\\\'0 0 16 9\\\\\\'%3E%3C/svg%3E)The evolution of the AR market will require efforts from a range of ecosystem players to drive both technological development and consumer adoption. Collaboration within the ecosystem will be essential to propel AR technology to its full potential, focusing on diverse areas such as improving connectivity, ensuring seamless transitions between devices, improving application and content relevance, addressing privacy concerns, and shaping the societal acceptance of AR/MR devices.As portable AR/MR devices, likely in glasses form, gain popularity and social acceptance for everyday use, their reliability and utility in various contexts will increasingly hinge on network and cellular connectivity. Network infrastructure must be optimized for widespread usage outside of home and on the go. Wide area connectivity or 5G hotspots will be vital in high-traffic locations such as airports, train/subway stations, arenas/concert venues, stores or shopping areas, social establishments such as cafes and restaurants, or while commuting.On the other hand, increased AR adoption and the use of smartphone-connected portable AR/MR devices will also present new revenue opportunities for communications service providers (CSPs) in both consumer and developer markets. For example, CSPs can offer higher tethering allowances for AR/MR devices and premium plans with quality of service (QoS) differentiation in high-traffic locations for consumers. Simultaneously, they can provide developers with network APIs optimized for XR traffic demands.#### What will AR development look like in the near future?![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns=\\\\\\' viewBox=\\\\\\'0 0 16 9\\\\\\'%3E%3C/svg%3E)## Methodology#### Qualitative research:22 in-depth interviews were conducted between April and June 2023 with 12 current AR/VR users, 7 industry experts and 3 XR startup companies: TagSpace, forwARdgame and EyecandyLab. Interviewees were located in the US, Japan, South Korea and Germany.#### Quantitative research:An online survey was fielded between July and August in 2023 in 10 markets. The sample consists of 10,000 early adopters aged 15 to 69, with 1,000 from each market, who use smartphone AR apps and/or VR/AR/MR headsets/glasses at least every other week or plan to do so in the next five years. The sample represents 280 million early adopters in the markets surveyed. While early adopters are a small fraction of consumers globally, their early adopter profile makes these individuals important when exploring how wider groups of consumers might use these technologies in the future. The respondents were asked a range of questions about their current usage, the perceived benefits, challenges,\\\\u202ffuture adoption intention, and expectations around XR-powered experiences in the next five years.!## Meet our authors!#### Huani YaoHuani is an experienced consumer researcher with more than 15 years of experience in studying consumers’ values, behaviors, and attitudes toward technology.

This includes:- Virtual Reality (VR), which usually involves the user wearing a headset that displays a simulation of the real world- Augmented Reality (AR), which enhances the real-world environment by overlaying digital elements- Mixed Reality (MR), which integrates elements of VR and AR, to create a blended experience where the virtual and physical interact seamlessly.Although XR technologies have existed for decades, there has been a surge in interest, investment and availability in recent years, especially in workplaces and consumer leisure sectors. The global market for XR is forecasted to surpass $1.1 trillion by 2030.Augmented reality content for mobile phones is already widely available for consumers to use in app stores like Google Play and the Apple App store, Bespoke platforms are also being developed in industrial and workplace settings.

Unfortunately, as with any emerging technology there is a risk that offenders may use these new environments to exploit children.The Alliance’s  highlighted the risks posed to child safety, including opportunities for offenders to access victims, distribute child sexual abuse material, simulate abuse of virtual children, and use haptics to mimic real-world sensations like movement and force. Predators can also exploit ‘off-platforming’, where they move communication from XR environments to other platforms to groom children.In May 2024, we facilitated a roundtable discussion with leading experts to discuss key risks, challenges and opportunities to make the metaverse and technologies safer. A summary paper, , outlines the key issues discussed and opportunities for action.Virtual reality users are usually isolated by the use of headsets, which can further exacerbate risks to children.> We know perpetrators will find any crack in platforms they can penetrate. There’s a huge amount of work to be done, but also a lot of “ knowledge we already have.>> Participant in WeProtect Global Alliance roundtable discussion on XR### Who is likely to be impacted?Children form a significant portion of the XR (Extended Reality) user base, with gaming becoming an integral part of their daily lives.  of children aged 7-10 revealed that they feel safest on private messaging apps and gaming platforms, even though these are often areas where online abuse occurs.Currently, many children worldwide cannot access these emerging technologies due to high costs, limited high-speed internet access, and the necessary hardware requirements. However, XR technologies are expected to become more prevalent in the near future as they become more affordable and accessible.#### Extended Reality (XR) statistics**$1.1 trillion** – the predicted global XR market by 2030Source: **75% of people** believe children are at significant risk of sexual abuse when using VR technologySource: **Four in 10** parents (41%) say they don’t know much, or anything, about the metaverse.

From unprecedented applications in healthcare, education, and training to profound shifts in social interactions and the world of design, VR continues to redefine the boundaries of what’s possible. In this blog, we’ll look at some of the VR trends of 2023, and offer some predictions that might shape the next decade of virtual exploration.### Top Trends in 2023Technology in gaming consistently breaks new ground. In 2023, VR gaming was no exception. The visuals in VR games have attained a level of sophistication that’s truly mesmerising, bolstering the sense of immersion. Game designers haven’t rested on their laurels; they keep exploring the nuances of the VR medium to astonishing effect. However, at , our attention was predominantly captured by VR’s increasing role in emulating real-world scenarios, such as in professional contexts or product visualisations. The corporate world is slowly waking up to the advantages VR can offer, particularly regarding training simulations.The software aspect of VR has also seen remarkable advancements. Companies like Unity and Unreal have provided VR developers with increasingly sophisticated tools, simplifying the creation process. The rise of OpenXR is also helpful, enabling software compatibility across a variety of headsets.### Predictions for the Near FutureThe hardware evolution isn’t slowing down. In the upcoming year, we’re anticipating several  releases, with  being particularly anticipated. The trajectory is clear: increasingly powerful capabilities will be packaged in sleeker, lighter designs. At Mersus, our focus has been on pioneering apps that favour hand tracking over traditional controllers, especially for mobile headsets. The market still has a limited number of entities producing VR training modules for untethered headsets utilising hand tracking. The question on our minds is: Will 2024 witness a more widespread transition to this format?### Immersive ExperiencesAs VR technology continues to advance, the line between the virtual and the real is becoming increasingly blurred. Future VR isn’t just about visuals; it aims to encompass all of our senses. This means that upcoming VR platforms are not only focusing on improving visual fidelity but are also diving into areas like haptic feedback, 3D audio, and even scent emulation. Such hyper-realistic simulations will do more than just entertain; they’ll challenge our very perceptions of reality. By engaging multiple senses, they can evoke stronger emotions, create more memorable experiences, and even be used in therapeutic settings. As we look ahead, the potential for VR to create entirely immersive worlds is both exciting and limitless.!### Integration with ARThe convergence of Augmented Reality (AR) and VR is shaping up to be one of the most significant technological junctions in recent times. While VR offers a complete immersion in a digital world, AR overlays virtual elements onto our physical surroundings. The blending of these two realms promises a seamless continuum where users can transition smoothly between fully immersive and augmented experiences. This integration has the potential to revolutionise industries. For instance, in the realm of design and architecture, professionals could switch between altering a virtual model in VR and visualising those changes in a real-world context through AR. Similarly, in the entertainment sector, gamers could transition between playing in a fully immersive world and having game elements interact with their physical surroundings. The intertwining of AR and VR not only opens up new avenues for user experiences but also sets the stage for the development of hardware and software that cater to this hybrid reality.### AI Integrations with VRArtificial Intelligence (AI) and VR together promise a dynamic synergy. One of the most promising uses of AI in VR is the customisation of user experiences through smart algorithms.\\\\xa0 This is most relevant to Mersus Technologies in the power AI can bring to tailoring a trainee on the  platform’s learning journey.Moreover, AI’s capability to procedurally generate VR environments can lead to expansive, intricately detailed landscapes. Such environments could be constantly evolving, offering unpredictability and novelty to users. Additionally, integrating AI can infuse Non-Playable Characters (NPCs) with a semblance of autonomy, making them more nuanced and engaging for users.The landscape of Virtual Reality is continuously evolving, presenting opportunities that refine our interaction with digital environments. As we stand at the threshold of further advancements in VR, it’s clear that the industry is charting a course towards even more immersive and nuanced experiences. Reflecting on the strides and innovations of recent years offers perspective on this progression. The future of VR promises enhanced realism and immersion, bridging the divide between the tangible and the virtual. As we move forward, the unfolding developments in Virtual Reality are sure to be both intriguing and impactful.### Consult, Design, Develop, Deploy & Analyse                   ## Related Posts]( “Meet Mersus” – Mersus’ inaugural official video biography]( Mar 2024]( the Synergy of AI and VR – AI and VR Integration]( Jul 2023]( for Training in Ireland (Demo)]( Feb 2019]( Evolution of Virtual Reality: Past, Present, and Future]( Mar 2025]( Training and Remote Work: A Game-Changer for Global Teams]( Mar 2025]( Stories of Virtual Reality Training]( Feb 2025]( Reality in Healthcare: Enhancing Patient Care]( Mar 2025]( Tracking: Elevating VR Training to the Next Level]( Feb 2025]( Learning: Why It Works]( Apr 2025]( Reality Glove – Interview with Dr Brendan O’Flynn (Demo)]( Jan 2018]( Reality The Game Changer for High-Risk Industries]( Mar 2025\\'}]', name='web_search_tool', call_id='call_a4KU8BXLdz8u57sYxvrs63bs', is_error=False), FunctionExecutionResult(content='[{\\'title\\': \\'The Top 5 VR Innovations Unveiled at CES 2023 - XpertVR 2025\\', \\'url\\': \\'https://xpertvr.ca/the-top-5-vr-innovations-unveiled-at-ces-2023/\\', \\'markdown\\': \"!![]( White decorative]( to content]( #1 - Magic LeapFor years, Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) have been on the brink of revolutionizing technology as we know it.

This milestone year in the evolution of augmented and virtual reality technology has been marked by significant product launches, technological advancements, and industry shifts.While we won’t be able to tell you which VR headset to buy in 2023 (that is always down to a matter of personal preference), in this post we’ll delve into these developments, specifically spotlighting some of the headlining headsets that have helped to redefine the shape of the AR and VR market, and that have set us up for what will be a breakthrough year for XR in 2024. And who knows, maybe reading this analysis will provide you with several reasons to get a VR headset, if you don’t already own one.## Headset Launches2023 was an amazing year for hardware enthusiasts, with dozens of exciting headset releases and announcements. We’ll dive into some of our top picks of the year.![]( HTC VIVE XR EliteThe VIVE XR Elite was introduced by HTC at CES 2023 at the beginning of the year. The device was really one of the first mainstream consumer XR brands to mark the shift towards what the industry is currently referring to as “mixed reality.” Priced at $1,099, the headset stands out for its lightweight and compact design, making it one of the most comfortable VR headsets available.It features a screen resolution of 2K pixels per eye (4K combined), a 110-degree field of view, and a 90Hz refresh rate, offering users a finely tuned viewing experience. Additionally, the VIVE XR Elite boasts 128GB of memory and 12GB of RAM.Going first is never easy, especially when an entire industry is watching and waiting to see what bar you are setting in order to fine tune their own offerings. However, despite the VIVE XR Elite coming out almost a year ago now, the headset is still one of the best mixed reality devices you can get at the moment, and an extremely solid contender within the standalone headset market. Plus, combining the device with VIVE’s enormous ecosystem of other hardware/software offerings and PC VR compatibility, it’s likely this device will still be the headset of choice for many this time next year.![]( **Apple Vision Pro**A solid picture of what Apple\\\\\\'s foray into the AR/VR domain is going to look like finally materialized this year, with the company announcing the Vision Pro, a spatial computing device set to ship in early 2024. Priced at $3,499, the headset features dual 4K displays, gesture tracking, and both an M2 chip and the new R1 chip that has been specifically designed for real-time processing of the real world. The Vision Pro packs an ultra-high-resolution display system with 23 million pixels across two displays (for reference, a 4K TV features more than 8 million pixels).As well as an entirely new device from Apple, the company has also built its new VisionOS, the brand new operating system on which the Vision Pro will run. Through a combination of some incredible hardware and a new powerful operating system, the Vision Pro has been designed to give users as lag-free an experience as possible, which in turn should help to tackle one of VR’s most common problems – motion sickness.Furthermore, in addition to the physical HMD and a new OS, the launch of the Vision Pro demonstrates Apple’s commitment to AR technology. The company rarely introduces a product without a viable use case, and its introduction of a new form factor highlights Apple’s bullish position on spatial computing as a new tool through which it can bring more value to users.The device is  to become available in March 2024, however this is yet to be confirmed by Apple themselves. Some industry commentators are  that the Vision Pro is the best headset that they have ever tried. Regardless of your opinion on Apple, it is hard to argue that the company’s entry into the XR market this year was probably the single most anticipated move by any tech company in the AR/VR space ever, and expectations are certainly running high for the upcoming headset.![]( **Meta Quest 3**Released in September at a price of $499.99, the Meta Quest 3 set a new standard in the XR headset market. Building on the success of the Quest 2, Meta’s Quest 3 device introduced a slimmer and lighter design, enhancing comfort for extended use. A significant 30% increase in visual resolution and a 40% louder audio range compared to its predecessor also marked major improvements.The Quest 3 was also the first device to feature Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 Snapdragon platform (more on this in a bit), coupled with 8GB of RAM, doubling the graphical power of the Quest 3 when compared with the Quest 2.Marketed as a “mixed reality\" device (for clarification on the terms, see our last blog post on the subject), the Quest 3’s AR passthrough capabilities on a VR headset have allowed creators and game developers to come up with entirely new ways in which users can interact with their surroundings. These advancements not only improve the user experience but also push the boundaries of what\\\\\\'s possible in virtual and mixed reality environments.![]( **Bigscreen Beyond**Also released in September 2023, Bigscreen Beyond is a groundbreaking VR headset, noted for being the world’s smallest, weighing just 127 grams, yet still packing a punch. Priced at $999, it features MicroOLED displays and advanced pancake optics, offering a high resolution of 5120 x 2560 pixels and up to 90 Hz refresh rates. Bigscreen Beyond\\\\\\'s slim profile is designed for comfort and fully supports VR games on Steam with compatibility to SteamVR tracking.The headset looks like something straight out of a futuristic sci-fi movie, and could well be paving the way for a future of small, slimline VR headset form factors. If this is how headsets look in 5-10 years time, we wouldn’t be disappointed. But the beauty is, you don’t have to wait half a decade to look like you’re already in Ready Player One - you can order your own Bigscreen Beyond device today!![]( **Lynx R1**The Lynx R1 only came out last month, but there have been enough demos of the headset for the market to know that Lynx is a serious player when it comes to functional XR hardware. The R1 is a groundbreaking mixed reality headset that stands out for its affordability and innovation. Priced at $849 for the standard edition, it offers a blend of VR and AR with a unique \"True Mixed Reality\" experience.The device prioritizes user experience, data sovereignty, and privacy, requiring no Facebook account or cloud connection, and allows for complete offline operation. Featuring the Snapdragon XR2 Gen 1 processor and \"4-fold catadioptric\" lenses, the R1 ensures a slimmer design and balanced weight distribution, making it a significant addition to 2023’s lineup of new XR headsets.The beautiful thing about the Lynx R1 is that it is truly helping to change people’s lives—for example, by helping those who are visually impaired to see more of the world—which alone is reason enough to include it in this blog post. You can  on stage with Chris McNally at AWE USA earlier this year highlighting the R1’s suitability as an assistive technology device.![]( **Varjo XR-4 Series**Only very recently announced (last week!) was Varjo’s latest lineup of headsets, the XR-4 series, which includes the XR-4, XR-4 Focal Edition and XR-4 Secure Edition. This most recent announcement from the company, whose headsets are known for their high-fidelity visuals and industrial-grade build, represents a significant leap in XR technology.Varjo\\\\\\'s headsets are a go-to choice for professionals in various fields such as design, engineering, and simulation training. The Varjo XR-4 Series seems like it will be setting a very high bar in the professional XR headset market, thanks to unparalleled visual fidelity and robust features. The company’s technology always seems to exemplify the power and potential of XR for transforming professional workflows, training, and research. However, this means that the devices come with quite a hefty price tag.The XR-4 series starts at $3,990, so definitely not the sort of device that users buying on a budget would be considering. However, with specs that  device (which also has its own hefty price tag), it will still have an appeal to professional consumers. Although initial availability for the XR-4 series will be reserved for enterprise purchases only, Varjo is offering a waitlist for those consumers that are looking for the absolute best level of visual fidelity in their XR experiences.![]( What Lies AheadThis review is by no means an exhaustive list, and there have been many other amazing headset launches and announcements that have taken place this year. However, there simply isn’t space to cover every single one of them in this post. But that in itself should be a very positive indicator for the XR industry, in that there is now so much choice when it comes to VR/MR devices, it signals that the industry is continuing to mature. Growth in demand from both consumers and the enterprise is helping to drive innovation across the sector, which can only be a good thing for the future of augmented, virtual and mixed reality technologies.Part two of this series will take a look at some of the other XR technologies that have been announced this year that have made a huge impact on the progress of the industry as a whole. While it is unknown exactly what new devices and headsets will arrive in 2024, one thing is for sure - you’ll be able to experience the latest in this cutting edge XR technology and get hands on with the latest VR and AR devices at AWE’s events next year.Super Early Bird tickets for AWE USA in Long Beach, California are still on sale for just $695, so make sure you’re a part of what will be the most exciting XR event of 2024.Plus, if you’re interested in participating in other ways, whether speaking, exhibiting, sponsoring, or joining AWE’s enterprise program, there are plenty of ways to  in next year’s events.Share This Article### Recent Post11 Sep 2025AWE Talks: Elevating Storytelling to StorylivingAWE USA 2025byMike Boland]( Sep 2025AWE Talks: Unlocking AI By Linking it to the Real WorldAWE USA 2025byMike Boland]( Sep 2025AWE Talks: A Bushel of Bushnell\\\\\\'sAWE USA 2025byMike Boland]( Sep 2025AWE Talks: Elevating Storytelling to StorylivingAWE USA 2025byMike Boland]( Sep 2025AWE Talks: Unlocking AI By Linking it to the Real WorldAWE USA 2025byMike Boland]( Sep 2025AWE Talks: A Bushel of Bushnell\\\\\\'sAWE USA 2025byMike Boland]( Sep 2025AWE Talks: Elevating Storytelling to StorylivingAWE USA 2025byMike Boland]( Sep 2025AWE Talks: Unlocking AI By Linking it to the Real WorldAWE USA 2025byMike Boland]( 1- 2- 3### Cookie settingsWe use cookies to provide you with the best possible experience.

Bystander privacy still looms large, hindering device adoptionBystander privacy, referring to consumers feeling exposed to others scanning them with AR devices, remains a critical concern among consumers, with 60 percent expressing apprehension globally. This worry significantly reduces the share of users intending to adopt AR devices by 18 percentage points.#### Augmented tomorrow: AR experiences beyond smartphones and AR filtersExploring consumer expectations and needs in an evolving XR landscape.]( 1. Consumers combining smartphones and AR devices will double in the next five yearsThe smartphone has become inseparable from consumers\\\\\\' lives, serving as an extension of their bodies. Its ubiquity makes it challenging for users to envision a replacement. While smartphones serve as the primary entry point for AR experiences, and consumer interest in AR experiences has been increasing steadily among 5G users in the past three years, overall satisfaction remains low, at only 42 percent, due to numerous limitations and challenges with current smartphone AR experiences, including limited applications, irrelevant content, small screens, arm fatigue, and low immersion.However, consumers who use both smartphone AR apps and VR/AR/MR headsets/glasses tend to be more satisfied with smartphone AR experiences, with almost half reporting content, about 10 percentage points higher than those who don’t use both. Today, about 1 out of 10 users utilize both smartphone AR and VR/AR/MR headsets/glasses, and this number is expected to double in the next five years. This highlights the undeniable importance of headsets/glasses in delivering comprehensive experiences alongside smartphones, despite ongoing challenges in achieving full consumer-friendliness.#### User groups - today versus in 5 years!Consumers expect AR/MR devices, likely in glasses form, to become companions to smartphones, with 62 percent expressing willingness to connect these devices to smartphones for elevated experiences, provided these devices will evolve and become compact, lightweight, and offer extended battery life.## 2. Consumers are hungry for on-the-go AR devices and willing to pay 20 percent more for the portabilityToday, VR/AR/MR headsets/glasses are predominantly used within homes and perceived as shared devices, with 64 percent of users reporting sharing their devices with household members. This highlights the current domestic and communal nature of such devices.However, as anticipation grows for the evolution and enhancement of AR/MR devices over the next five years, three-quarters of consumers express a desire to extend their usage beyond home settings. This shift mirrors the historical trajectory of the telephone, which transformed from a stationary household device to a mobile, personal essential. As AR/MR devices become more portable, advanced, sleek, affordable and socially acceptable, they are poised to transition into personal, everyday accessories akin to smartphones.In fact, the desire for increased portability is so pronounced that consumers are willing to pay an average of 20 percent premium for devices usable outside of home. Locations that can command relatively higher price premiums compared to home are arenas or concert venues, common shopping areas/centers and social establishments such as cafes and restaurants.#### Percentage points difference in price\\\\xa0willing to payThree quarters of consumers expect to be able to use AR/MR headsets on-the-go in the next five years.Price premium (relative to other locations)Select allAt home: -8%On a plane: 18%While commuting: 21%At the workplace: 25%In cafes or restaurants: 27%In shopping areas/stores: 28%In arenas/concert venues: 33%No data to display.Desired locations to use AR/MR headsets in the next five years\"I think (bringing XR devices outside-of-home) is more important because at home there\\\\\\'s only so much that you can do. It\\\\\\'d be great if I could bring it outside. For example, bringing it to vacations, to other countries.\"- XR user, Japan## 3. As AR technology advances in adapting to geospatial surroundings, the range of experiences will become more diverse and demanding on 5GAs the industry advances, we foresee a three-stage transition for consumer AR experiences over the next five years.Initially, basic AR experiences, such as social, and informational applications, will become widely available to consumers. This stage has already commenced and will continue to evolve in the coming one to two years. This is followed by the second stage during which more location-based and geospatially aware experiences will become widely accessible to consumers thanks to the expected advancement in geospatial AR technology. Finally, more advanced, and native experiences will begin to emerge and gradually become widely available to consumers. For instance, consumers will be able to enjoy mixed reality cinematic experiences anywhere and have 3D digital exercise companions during workouts.As AR experiences evolve, the devices available to consumers will also undergo a transformation. This evolution will commence with smartphones dominating the initial stage, followed by lightweight, portable AR/MR devices acting as companions to smartphones, enabling outside-the-home and on-the-go use. Eventually, standalone AR/MR devices will emerge to facilitate native and more advanced experiences.!## 4. Bystander privacy still looms large, hindering device adoptionWhile early adopters have shown interest in XR, the adoption among the general population still lags. This slow uptake is attributed to a variety of factors, including technological challenges, device design, social acceptance, alongside privacy concerns.Social acceptance plays a crucial role in influencing consumer adoption. Over 60 percent express reluctance to use AR/MR devices publicly unless they are visually appealing. Additionally, more than half are apprehensive about potential health and safety risks. Another significant aspect of social acceptance is bystander privacy, meaning consumers are exposed to others taking pictures or videos with AR/MR devices. While fewer consumers, around 2 out of 10, show concern about being captured by others using AR/MR devices as bystanders, many more, around 6 out of 10, show concern if these pictures and videos are shared with others, with or without their consent.The amassed impact of bystander privacy issues influences consumers\\\\\\' willingness to adopt AR/MR devices. This becomes evident when examining the share of consumers intending to purchase an AR/MR device. Notably, for those who are concerned about bystander privacy, the intention to adopt is 18 percentage points lower than for those who are not concerned.#### Bystander privacy concern - impact on AR device adoptionUsers who are not concernedUsers who are concernedSelect allz-empty-common-0No data to display.Share of users who will buy an AR/MR device during the first year\"Previous headsets made people look stupid and people may look at you weirdly if you wear AR glasses.\"- XR user, the US## Implications on the 5G network![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns=\\\\\\' viewBox=\\\\\\'0 0 16 9\\\\\\'%3E%3C/svg%3E)The evolution of the AR market will require efforts from a range of ecosystem players to drive both technological development and consumer adoption. Collaboration within the ecosystem will be essential to propel AR technology to its full potential, focusing on diverse areas such as improving connectivity, ensuring seamless transitions between devices, improving application and content relevance, addressing privacy concerns, and shaping the societal acceptance of AR/MR devices.As portable AR/MR devices, likely in glasses form, gain popularity and social acceptance for everyday use, their reliability and utility in various contexts will increasingly hinge on network and cellular connectivity. Network infrastructure must be optimized for widespread usage outside of home and on the go. Wide area connectivity or 5G hotspots will be vital in high-traffic locations such as airports, train/subway stations, arenas/concert venues, stores or shopping areas, social establishments such as cafes and restaurants, or while commuting.On the other hand, increased AR adoption and the use of smartphone-connected portable AR/MR devices will also present new revenue opportunities for communications service providers (CSPs) in both consumer and developer markets. For example, CSPs can offer higher tethering allowances for AR/MR devices and premium plans with quality of service (QoS) differentiation in high-traffic locations for consumers. Simultaneously, they can provide developers with network APIs optimized for XR traffic demands.#### What will AR development look like in the near future?![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns=\\\\\\' viewBox=\\\\\\'0 0 16 9\\\\\\'%3E%3C/svg%3E)## Methodology#### Qualitative research:22 in-depth interviews were conducted between April and June 2023 with 12 current AR/VR users, 7 industry experts and 3 XR startup companies: TagSpace, forwARdgame and EyecandyLab.
